However, after eating at Mentai-Ya, I grew to love the Mentai sauce, especially, the spicy Mentai. The fact that the sauce is torched before serving makes the sauce more fragrant and eliminates the Ã¢â\\x82¬Å\\x93fishyÃ¢â\\x82¬Â\\x9d taste as well.

Highly recommended!', 'Went to this newly opened Mentai Ya in Sengkang, and give a shot to try their mentaiko katsu and salmon don. Was very disappointed with:\\n\\n1. The rice: we know that the Japanese rice are known to be mushy-texture but if you cook with too much water, it will become Ã¢â\\x82¬Å\\x93ba-zhang gluttonousÃ¢â\\x82¬Â\\x9d rice. This rice was served to me and I went back and gave this feedback to the chef, but was greeted with ignorant attitude and replied, Ã¢â\\x82¬Å\\x93the rice is like that one..Ã¢â\\x82¬Â\\x9d\\n\\n2. The quantity of rice is way below expectation. \\n\\n3. We order Salmon and Fried Chicken. The quality of Salmon is poor and the fried chicken is just ok. \\n\\n4. Mentai-Ko sauce is ok. But to be brutally honest, you can buy this sauce easily in Don Don Donki.\\n\\nConclusion: if you are hungry, donÃ¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢t expect this to fill your stomach. Price paid is not justifiable.\\n\\nFeedback to the chef, please cook the rice with pride. It is a critical part of this dish. The rice is Ã¢â\\x82¬Å\\x93NOT like this oneÃ¢â\\x82¬Â\\x9d. \\n\\nOverall is disappointed.', 'Delicious! DonÃ¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢t really eat mentaiko much but itÃ¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s really nice!

Worth the travel :)', 'was looking forward to try mentai ya in sengkang. ordered via grabfood and food does arrive relatively hot /warm. however was disappointed with the mentaiko sauce, which is jelat due to high mayo content. rice is normal chinese rice which lack of the overall combination with the japanese style chicken/salmon mentai, didnt blend in well together. so overall, wont try it again.', 'i had spicy salmon today. it nice but the portion is too little.', 'Overpriced, please reduce price by 20%.
