1,"I have always respected the younger generation to venture into the hawker industry. But definitely not for this particular hawker. With such an attitude, I will never patronise this shop anymore"
1,"Food was kinda disappointing compared to the good reviews written online. Not very value in terms of taste for the price... I wont be queuing again.

The issue is the service staff who has a poor attitude when taking customers order/requests and does not seem trained when it comes to food handling. On multiple occasions saw this staff scratching her hair then handling customer's food and not wearing mask properly."
1,"The chicken was cold..... new establishment so that's ok, theres always room for improvements.

1/5. Mainly for the poor attitude and rude girl taking order. When told the food is cold, she just stares at u. Terrible especially when some of us work in the service industry. She could have nicely communicated but chose to act snobbish.

Would have given 2 stars for the food, 0 star for the person taking order. Thus 1 star rating."
1,"Could have given 0 if possible

Extremely disappointed with the Pork Belly Katsu Don & Beef Don

Both dishes fell way below expectations and do not expect your food to look
even similar to what was shown on the menu

Katsu was soggy, Beef was tough

Will not visit again

Pricing wise @ S$6.90 you can tastier food than this at Marine Parade Hawker Centre with spare change"
1,Very Good Place
1,Not good at all.
2,"Have always wanted to try this but only open at noon. (So has severely limited my ability to eat this earlier cos I prefer to eat lunch before 12noon)
tried the spicy pork collar —
Did not look as nice as the photos.  It was incredibly yellow…. Curry powder as the primary ingredient in the pork? I would have expected it to be drizzled in spice powders…..  if I knew it was curry powder I would not have ordered this!!!

The meat dishes were fried on the spot…. And the pork shreds were not properly separated and ended up stuck together, clumped together, I was worried it be uncooked in between.

The so called onsen egg was only ‘50%’ there. Had a video but could not put it up.  Only a little egg yolk oozed out, the rest were semi hard.

Semi generous in the spring onions but wish they gave a bit more (even tho I asked for more); or to have a bit more garnishing.  Since it fusion, how about fried garlic chips/crumbs or even shallots.

Unlikely I will go back to try their other dishes."
2,"Was recommended by my family to come and try. First of all, I am always skeptical when I see sprinkles of furikake and powders on top of the bowl, because the Japanese themselves rarely do that as it mostly skews the taste of the meat and rice. Portion is decent. But the worst of all was the rice. Never seen such a bad rice before. Don't even talk about it being Japanese rice or not, it's dry and brittle as hell. Felt like overnight rice or something. Tried to be understanding, but man it was super disappointing."
2,"Didn’t enjoy the food. Too egg was too sweet, and the pork katsu very flat. Waste of calories"
2,Nothing special. Ordered beef short plate. Slight tough to chew. Not a good value when you are served with a bowl full of rice with little meats. Was hoping the quality would outweigh the quantity. Both seems lacking. These young lads are very hardworking though.
2,"Not bad. Interesting new generation food. Queue is pretty long but not worth the wait as the portion is small and nothing special... for the size, the price is on the high side."
3,"New stall at this hawker centre. Had the chicken karaage with curry sauce and rice for $4.50 - impressed by the huge portion for such a price. I left the place feeling extremely full. The chicken was served piping hot, and the thigh meat was well marinated, very tender, and layered with a well seasoned, crisp and light batter.

The curry sauce was interesting as I expected it to be Japanese curry but it seemed like a rendition of McDonald’s curry sauce (but a more pineapple-y version of it).

The additional side of potato salad though, was extremely disappointing which contributed to the reduction in stars for this review. While the serving size was also larger than what I had expected, this seemed more like an onion salad. There was a disproportionately large amount of almost-raw, crunchy onions in the salad which ruined the entire dish.

Overall some hits and misses - would rate it 3.5 stars. Worth giving them a chance if you’re in the area."
3,"Always wanted to try this stall at Marine Parade hawker center, but they are always closed. Little did I realise their operating hours is 12-3pm only and 6pm till sold out? And they are closed on Monday. It’s quite complicating. Anyway, on to the food. Ordered the Spicy garlic pork collar Don w/ onsen egg ($6.60) and the Homemade chicken karaage w/ curry sauce ($4.50)

The spicy garlic pork collar Don was so-so. For the amount and price, it was slightly pricey. The Karaage with curry sauce on the other hand was really nice. Light, crispy, chicken tender inside. Goes well with the curry sauce although the curry sauce tastes like from McDonald’s. Overall, decent food, slightly high prices."
3,"The rice looks like it's short-grain but tastes just like the rice you get from an average cai fan stall. The sukiyaki beef don was okay in terms of price-to-meat ratio, and the beef strips were pretty tender. Onsen egg texture was also on point. But unfortunately, I really hated the rice quality so I wouldn't be back. The Spicy Marinated Pork Collar wasn't great for us too. The so-called pork collar is actually made with minced pork and didn't have the flavour or texture we were expecting. Given the price point, these are forgiveable but there's also nothing to draw me back, unless I can just dabao onsen eggs a la carte."
3,"Got the sukiyaki Beef Don with egg. It stated that there's onions but somehow I don't think I ate or tasted any?

The rice was not bad, drenched with the beef drippings which added some flavour to the plain rice.
Furikake was placed on top of the meat only and didn't really add much value to the dish. Tasted more of the togarashi powder which is the Japanese chili powder.
Beef was tender but they could have been more generous with the amount given. The teriyaki sauce was okay, tasted like how it should be.
For my onsen egg, was a little disappointed as the yolk already broke.

Overall an average tasting don with a constant queue of customer."
3,It was a nice bowl of katsudon. I felt it was bit on the salty side and it wasn’t anything special. Price was reasonable given the small portion but was it worth the 30 mins wait? Maybe not. I may be tempted if the queue was shorter.
3,"Hits and misses for me, some good, some not. First time I tried the short beef, was impressed. Now trying the pork coller, its below average so i hv to go for a 3-star"
3,Thought that it was way too salty. Was really quite average taste-wise. Seems overpriced to me at $6.60.
3,ok..
4,Very decent and delicious donburi .. finally had the chance to try it as it’s not always opened when I’m in the area. Managed to buy and try different dons. All four are pretty good.
4,Pretty good donburi for a very cheap price. Rice doesn't taste all that Japanese unfortunately.
4,"Humble stall at a hawker centre not far from ECP - good effort run by some youngsters & food is not bad.

I’ll visit again if I’m in the area, just won’t queue for it if the line is long.

Happy to support young entrepreneurs."
4,Ordered the Pork Belly Katsu Don. Good texture and taste but could do with a complimentary Miso Soup.
4,"Try the pork belly katsu don, it’s soft and tender. The fries are also crispy and potatoey, great with the curry sauce!"
4,The sukiyaki beef don is my go-to order at Fukudon! Very tasty and affordable!
4,"There was already a long queue when I arrived before the store opened. The queue started before the stall opened at 12, so do be prepared to wait. We ordered the Short Plate Beef Bowl, Tonkatsu Bowl, Katsu Platter and Thunder Crunchy fries to share among 3 pax. The Katsu Platter and Tonkatsu Bowl were nicely executed for deep fried items - though we felt that we had slightly too much fried stuff towards the end. The beef bowl was much lighter and went well with the onsen egg. The rice in both bowls were a bit ""heavy"". The Thunder Crunchy Fries live up to their name in crispness, and comes with a nice (though not unique) dip."

5,Karaage here is super sexy ???? freshly fried and crispy. All the donburi are really good and affordable. Will definitely come here again for comfort food
5,"Located at Marine Parade hawker, this stall specializes in dons.

We has the sukiyaki don and the katsu don. Both were very good and the soft boiled eggs were perfectly cooked. Flavours were on point, wasn't expecting this from a hawker stall. ??

The food is very reasonably priced too.

Expect a queue if you are going during peak hours and this place only accepts cash."

5,"Have been patronising this stall for a few months with my friends. The food is always of standard, and it’s definitely worth it for the price. The portion is good! For a dollar more, you can have a double portion of chicken! (Good for you people trying to clock in your protein)

Ps. I’ve read through the other reviews. & I think if you’ve too, please give it a try on your own. Cause IMO, it’s definitely worth it. Kudos to the chef!!

Staff service maybe slightly improved. But overall, the food makes me a happy girl."
5,"I went to order pork katsudon today, there was a long queue. I placed my order, then went back to my table. When I went to pick up my order, I saw it was already in a plastic bag. I rushed  to collect my order and went back home. Then I realized at home there were two packages instead of just one, it turned out I took the wrong order and it was someone else’s.

My two daughters liked the beef and salmon order that I accidentally took. I tried to contact them through WhatsApp, and the response was very fast, they understood and asked me to come back and return the food or to keep on the house. We are very happy with the order and the service!"
5,Had a takeaway pork belly don with added beef. Taste and texture was good and the portion was more than enough. Price was fair for the quality and portion. Will recommend whoever is in the area to try the store. Would come back to try dining in at the hawker as I can only imagine how fantastic the food would be eating it fresh out of the kitchen!
5,"FOOD IS AWESOME. Chef Remus even provided delivery personally.

Chicken Katsu and Mentaiko is a must try!!!"
5,"Love their Salmon Don (and I always request to add egg!). Comes with generous portion of tomato and oranges. (Sounds weird combo, but is very very very delicious!).
Their Salmon is a must try!"
5,This place is a hidden gem. Fantastic dons at very reasonable prices. Great value for money! Will be back again soon.
5,"Ordered in for reservist, food received as packed well and still tasted delicious. Free delivery for orders above $50, minimum order amount starts from $20 ($10 delivery fee islandwide).

Menu is very diverse, will definitely have something for everyone. Ordered their blackboard menu special, which was satay pork collar with achar and egg floss. Pork was very tasty and tender!!! Will definitely come back.

Heard they are opening an outlet in Punggol soon and can’t wait to have Fukudon in my hood…"

5,"Tasty again, got pork belly donburi and karaage this time. Worth the wait,  and love that it's so close to home."

5,"Nice & delicious and also very affordable price.

5,"Ordered the Karage  with homemade curry. The Karage tasted really good, super crispy on the outside  and moist on the inside and the curry went well okay with the rice. Topped up 50cents for rice so my meal costed about $5. Will come back again next time :)"
