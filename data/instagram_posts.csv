All our dons are freshly prepared upon order to ensure that every bowl has the same consistency and taste! 🤤🤤🤤\n\nStep 1: We will place our short plate into our sukiyaki base to cook, whilst the chef prepares the soften onions on the pan!\n\nStep 2: Once the sukiyaki beef is cooked to perfection we mix the onions together to create a mixture of sweet and soft textures and flavours. \n\nStep 3: We will first start with overlaying the rice with the beef and onions.\n\nStep 4: Last but not least before serving, we will crack one Onsen egg over the bowl to give the bowl a creamy and silky texture to the don! We will drizzle the dons with our homemade sauce followed by garnishing with furikake and freshly chopped Green onions!\n\nAt Fúkudon, we take pride in providing a hearty and well prepared don while not losing out on quality and taste! Just like home cooked food, it will leave your tummies and hearts satisfied!

Sounds simple, though, getting the right ratio down and cooking reduction levels plays a major role on how our sauciness enhances how our dishes blend together. Soy sauce gives a dark rich salty bean flavour that compliments the mirin and sake to harmonise depth in our dishes. We specifically chose @yamasausa as it isn’t too salty allowing the flavourful beans to speak for itself. A very straight forward taste that imparts umami that accentuates the natural flavours of our selected meats.
