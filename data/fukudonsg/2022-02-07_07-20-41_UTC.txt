Let us bring you behind the scenes and show you what happens when we prepare our Beef Sukiyaki Short Plate Don! All our dons are freshly prepared upon order to ensure that every bowl has the same consistency and taste! ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤

Step 1: We will place our short plate into our sukiyaki base to cook, whilst the chef prepares the soften onions on the pan!

Step 2: Once the sukiyaki beef is cooked to perfection we mix the onions together to create a mixture of sweet and soft textures and flavours. 

Step 3: We will first start with overlaying the rice with the beef and onions.

Step 4: Last but not least before serving, we will crack one Onsen egg over the bowl to give the bowl a creamy and silky texture to the don! We will drizzle the dons with our homemade sauce followed by garnishing with furikake and freshly chopped Green onions!

At FÃºkudon, we take pride in providing a hearty and well prepared don while not losing out on quality and taste! Just like home cooked food, it will leave your tummies and hearts satisfied! Come down to any of our stores to try our Beef Sukiyaki Short Plate Don now! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³
