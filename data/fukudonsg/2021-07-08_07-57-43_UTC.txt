“During my secondary school days, my friends and I would Q up during recess to buy our favorite Donburi bowls. We squeezed a load of Mayonnaise on top of our meals, making it even more sinful and scrumptious. I had always yearned to create my own version of Donburi bowls with that same warm and hearty feel. Being able to bring my memories to life through Fúkudon is not only nostalgic but a great joy knowing everyone else can feel the same.” Chef Remus
