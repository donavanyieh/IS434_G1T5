We have heard you! 
A popular blackboard menu item at our flagship outlet is here to stay at our new Punggol outlet!

The Wagyu Onigiri Don, a great infusion of quality and homeliness will be on the menu permanently at Punggol! 

Our wagyu is cooked to the perfect doneness, so to not lose its flavour and tenderness. Accompanied by our soy marinated soft boiled egg and our home-made pickled cucumber as a palate cleanser. We are sure it will leave you craving for more!

Come down to our new outlet on the 13th December to give our Wagyu Onigiri Don a try!
