Simple but mouth-watering is the perfect way to describe our homemade Chicken Karaage! Juicy yet crunchy, our karaage retains its crispiness while not losing the natural juiciness of the chicken thigh. 🤤🤤🤤

A staple in any Japanese meal, we have put our own twist to this very homely dish by accompanying it with our very own curry sauce. Our curry sauce is packed with flavours and scents from the ingredients that are sourced locally! 🥳🌶🥳

Our Chicken Karaage is available at both our Marine Parade and Punggol Outlets! Don't miss out the karaage
when you visit our stores! We hope to see you soon! 😁😁😁
