Mirin in the ring, throwing in that Unami punch! 

The Ingredient Series features the products we choose to emphasize meanings to its benefits, sourcing and flavor components behind them. 

Mirin is the 1/3 of our special blend sauce that is a cooking rice wine adding mild sweetness, shine, and fragrant aroma to our dishes! We specifically use Hon Mirin, the real stuff that is fermented glutinous rice with Shochu a distilled alcohol, and cultured with koji. The result makes it sweet without added sugar or corn syrup. Hon Mirin is such an ingredient that speaks for itself through the harmony of flavors creating an Unami sensation that every one of our customers should enjoy! Look out for that richness and subtle tang making it a shiok FÃºkudon bite each time.
