The Santoku Knives used by Chef Remus since the beginning of his career were gifted by his lovely wife! He uses it to fillet fishes, butcher meats, and chop vegetables as its sharp steel blade gives a smooth cut each time. Chef Remus finds that the Santoku knives are perfect for chopping as their handles are designed for comfortable wrist action for tougher ingredients. FÃºkudon is a hawker stall that values how our food tastes but also how it feels! We take pride in doing so through our dedication to sharpen our Santoku Knives for 1 hour each time, alongside the oil and care so that our tools can deliver the best bites to your table!
