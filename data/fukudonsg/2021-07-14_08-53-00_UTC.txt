It's always a delightful moment when neighboring vendors come to eat at our stall! Da Jie from the Noodle Shop tried our Chicken Don Buri today and expressed great enjoyment from the burst of flavors! She is from mainland China so trying Fúkudon’s dish as a new cuisine is something exciting for her and we are proud to be a part of her foodie journey!
