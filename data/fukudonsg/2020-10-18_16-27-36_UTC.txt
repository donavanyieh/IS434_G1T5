Harmony 
Harmony defines as the quality of forming a pleasant and consistent whole. After elaborating on all 5 factors, it all boils down to this. Whether an ingredient works very well on its own but when put together in a bowl is the most challenging part of developing the menu. It is impossible to please everyone albeit Chef Remus believes that one can be always true to one’s cooking, which is exactly why he has chosen to take this path since young. 

“At the end of the day, as long as my customers put a smile on their faces, thanking me for the food I have served, I'm forever grateful for the opportunity to serve them. This is how I create Harmony in my food.” - Chef Remus
