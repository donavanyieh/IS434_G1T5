Satay Pork Collar Onigiri, Homemade Achar and Onsen Egg. Beautifully garnished with strings of Golden Egg Floss. [$8.60]

In this week’s blackboard, we bring to you satay on rice. Combining a locally familiar Singapore dish into our donburi. Balanced with a homemade achar made with the freshest vegetable and fruits from our very own 84 Marine Parade Market. 

Definitely a bowl worth trying! 
So come down to Fukudon now to get it before it is gone! 😋✌🏻
