CHICKEN BREAST OYAKODON [$5.80]

If I were to ask you: Chicken Thigh or Chicken Breast, which would you choose? Many of us would definitely choose Thigh because they are fattier, making it juicier compared to other parts. Chicken Breast is often neglected because they are stereotyped as dry and flavourless. 

But fret not, here at FÃºkudon, you will get a piece of the wholesome, tender and juicy chicken breast!  Served with soft onions, fluffy eggs and a special broth. The pan of delicious combination will then be laid gently on a bed of fluffy Japanese rice. It is definitely a comfort dish to have, any time of the day! ðŸ˜Œ
