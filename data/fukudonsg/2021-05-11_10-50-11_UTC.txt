This week we highlight your grandma’s classic- Soy Sauce!

The Ingredient Series features the products we choose to emphasize meanings to its benefits, sourcing and flavour components behind them. Yes, we are a passionate bunch on every single detail. 

Our special blend comprises of Mirin, Soy Sauce and Sake. Sounds simple, though, getting the right ratio down and cooking reduction levels plays a major role on how our sauciness enhances how our dishes blend together. Soy sauce gives a dark rich salty bean flavour that compliments the mirin and sake to harmonise depth in our dishes. We specifically chose @yamasausa as it isn’t too salty allowing the flavourful beans to speak for itself. A very straight forward taste that imparts umami that accentuates the natural flavours of our selected meats. Some say soy sauce also has antioxidants that help reduce inflammation and improves overall digestion!
