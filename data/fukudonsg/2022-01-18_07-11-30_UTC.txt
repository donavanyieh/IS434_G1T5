Take a look at our Shoyu Glazed Salmon Don, a signature in both our Marine Parade and Punggol outlets!

At fukudon, we only use Norwegian salmons, that are of the highest quality. Norwegian salmons have a distinct flavour as well as packed with nutrients! Our salmons are cooked in our seasoned flour before it is tossed into our shoyu sauce, where its cooked to perfection!

Our sauce is a mixture of mirin and shoyu (Japanese Soy Sauce), a perfect mix of Sweet and Savoury while exhibiting a hint of saltiness. Accompanied with an onsen egg and our in house tomato salad, incorporating a mixture of locally grown tomatoes, with Japanese cucumbers, onions and orange, topped off with roasted sesame dressing and furikake. A combination worth trying!

Come on down to any of our locations to give our Shoyu Glazed Salmon Don a try! We hope to see you guys soon!
