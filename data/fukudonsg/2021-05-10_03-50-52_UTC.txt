*SideDish Giveaway*

This Hari Raya we want to commerate the essence of family by highlighting side dishes as a way to celebrate the festivity! Not only is it warm to share with your loved ones, side dishes make a well rounded meal by enhancing flavours to create contrast and taste. 

FÃºkudon would like to extend our gratitude by serving complimentary side dishes during our dinner services (6-8pm) paired with any order for one week! You may choose between: 

- Homemade chunky yet creamy potato salad made fresh daily. 
- Thunder Crunchy Battered Fries served w/ homemade curry sauce, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. 
- Special In-house marinated Chicken Karaage fried to perfection served w/ our homemade curry sauce.

Simply follow our page and like this post to redeem, 1 complimentary side dish per social account and order.

Here's to a Happy Hari Raya!
