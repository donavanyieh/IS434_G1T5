As we draw closer to the opening of FuÃÅkudon, let us review with Chef Remus the last 2 factors evaluated in developing the menu for you: Flavour & Harmony. 

(1/2) Flavour 
Flavour is an incredibly complex topic. It has a unique way of touching our hearts. It could be from a particular experience or reminiscing smells of one‚Äôs childhood. Flavour brings about the warmth and memories. Therefore, Chef Remus always strive to find the balance to extract the most eventful flavour when you take a mouthful from our rice bowls @fukudonsg üçö
