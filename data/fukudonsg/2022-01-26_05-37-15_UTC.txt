🐯🧧 Let us usher in a Roarsome Lunar New Year this year with 2 special creations from Fúkudon! 
Our favourite local dishes with a twist, the Chilli Crab Salmon Don & Salted Egg Chicken Karaage! 🥳

🌶Chili Crab Salmon Don 🦀
A Singapore dish we all know and love, a mixture of our homemade rempah and our seafood stock. 
Not forgetting the balance between tomato ketchup and chilli sauce, this is definitely a classic flavour that you don’t want to miss! Did we mention that real crab meat is also used in this dish? 
Paired with a refreshing salad, giving it an extra crunch to the donburi!

🥚Salted Egg Chicken Karaage🍗

We use locally sourced Salted Egg to dress our home-made Chicken Karaage, paired with the creaminess of the milk and a hint of spice from the chilli padi, a match made in heaven! We are sure it will leave you craving for more after the first bite!

Available exclusively at our Punggol outlet only. 
Limited portions daily from 27th January (Thursday) onwards, so come on down to 660A Edgedale Plains to get it before it’s gone! 🔥
