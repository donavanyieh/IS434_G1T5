This post focuses on two key factors in creating your food: Colour and Aroma.

As the common saying goes, “We eat with our eyes first”.
Colours of food always leave us a visual memory because they are the first thing we experience. Chef Remus diligently selects each colour component of the dish to ensure that they work harmoniously together to create a memorable impression.

The aroma reaches our noses before the food touches our mouths. Our sense of smell helps us to unravel the food before tasting it. Using his expertise and past knowledge, Chef Remus chooses only the freshest ingredients for his bowls at Fúkudon.
