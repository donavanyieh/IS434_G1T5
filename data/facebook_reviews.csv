People behind the counter were really nice and friendly.
Ordered a pork belly katsu Don, a katsu platter and an extra serving of rice with onsen egg. And its all less than $20. 😜😜

Tried the Pork Katsu don & Beef don 

Both fell way below expectations 

Katsu was soggy & Beef was tough

Had it at Marine Parade outlet

Punggol outlet might be better",https://www.facebook.com/joel.ta.52090,Joe Ta,2021-12-20T20:56:35.000Z,100050760307816,,https://www.facebook.com/fukudonsg/reviews/?ref=page_internal,2022-02-10T08:20:04.175Z
