"Very hearty amounts, even despite me asking for less rice. The mentaiko amounts are generous and filled with umami.

Salmon slice is thick and delicious, a little bigger than I expected. And the mentaiko fries didn’t disappoint too.

Overall value for money, probably need to work abit on making the rice w sauce more tasty and I would have been perfect ??"
I absolutely loved the food here! I had the salmon with mentaiko and rice alongside fries and it was a great lunch out. The portions were particularly large considering the very affordable price. 10/10 would go again!
"Hands down the best mentaiko place! The spicy salmon packs a punch — making it a very shiok meal to pair with a cold drink. However, the fried chicken cutlet with mentaiko stole the show for me. It was juicy, crispy and just went so well with the mentaiko without feeling too greasy (jelak). I would suggest getting the mentaiko fries with it because I honestly couldn’t get enough of it!"
"I ordered the salmon and chicken mentai-ya and they were absolutely delicious. The chicken was crispy and the salmon was fresh. The portion is very generous and yes, the rice too was nice and soft. Will come back and eat again someday (although the location was a bit out of the way) !"
Ordered the spicy salmon mentai don. A tad too spicy for me. But the taste was good. A little too plain for $8.80. Will be good if it comes with some seaweed or pickled ginger (like how they serve in Japan). There isit much “char” taste although they torched the mentaiko Mayo sauce on top of the salmon. There’s some teriyaki sauce drizzled on the white jasmine rice.
"Hard Undercooked Rice!

The standard seem to be not constant. Sometime alright, sometime not so good.

Today (1st Nov 2021), the standard quite bad. Bought the chicken and salmon mentai. Rice is undercooked and hard.
Chicken Not tender, dry and seem quite small.

Lucky today salmon is alright today, someday it too dry.

Not worth the price."
"Ordered the gyoza, soft shell crab, chicken and salmon mentaiko don

For the mentaiko don:
- Salmon skin is soggy
- Portion size is small
- No side dishes e.g. shredded cabbage, or seasoned seaweed
- Very plain, just rice and protein with mentaiko sauce.
- Mentaiko sauce is mainly mayo and on the saltish side.
- Mentaiko not burnt enough (It is called aburi for a reason)
- Turn jelat at the end of the meal, as no side dishes to mitigate the jelat-ness

Not worth the price due to the quality and portion size.

For gyoza:
- Slightly dry

For soft shell crab:
- Totally dry
- Crab size is small

Both side dishes ain't worth trying

Overall, a overhyped place offers disappointing meal.

Willing to try again if they improve.(Will follow up based on others google review)"
"Had the Spicy Salmon Mentai Don with a side of Gyoza! For such a price, the salmon tastes fresh with a strong but not overpowering spicy mentai sauce on it. Definitely a great value for all :)"
ordered mentaiko salmon don and the mentaiko amount was so generous! satisfied my mentaiko cravings ????. the gyoza was nice and crispy too. the chicken cutlet is very thick so it’s quite dry. would recommend the mentaiko salmon don more!
"Great place to satisfy mentaiko cravings, very affordable. Had the mentaiko salmon and spicy mentaiko fried chicken. Mentaiko mayo was really good and the heat in the spicy mentaiko made it better."
"A Gem in my neighbourhood. Salmon is thick, rice is well cooked and mentaiko sauce is tasty with a little spiciness. Will
try their softshell crab next visit."
Decided to try Mentai-Ya since it's nearby. Ordered x2 mentai salmon Dons. Taste was great not too salty or overcooked. Had a wonderful dinner. Hope your business prospers! Unethical competitors won't last long don't need to worry so much. Good job keep up the good work.
Great value and tasty food! I had the unagi tama don  and the mentaiko soft shell crab but i forgot to take a pic of that one. I'm gonna get the salmon next time I'm in the east!
"Came here many times! Affordable pricing and place is new and clean!

Salmon mentai don s$8.80 each
Tamago mentai yaki s$4.80 (3pcs)
Mentai fries s$4.80"
"Really amazing food at decent prices that is newly opened in my estate!!! My favourite is the salmon mentai don which costs $8.80 that has a generous serving of salmon + mentaiko sauce drizzled over. Love the mentai fries too!!!

Please don’t find it expensive for hawker food. Where can you find Japanese food that has generous servings of mentaiko sauce for under $10?"
Had the spicy salmon mentaiko alongside the mentaiko fries and rly loving the sweet tangy mentaiko! Spicy salmon was of the right spice level and the salmon cutlet was of a big portion! Value for money!
Really affordable mentaiko salmon don in the neighbourhood! Loved the spicy mentai sauce and the mentai fries were delicious too!
"Decided to try out the food here and it's pretty good value! I personally tried the Chicken Katsu Curry Don, and despite using chicken fillet, it's about as tender as one can expect. The curry is just nice, neither too sweet nor too spicy. The generous servings of mentaiko sauce would suit some just fine I believe, though it was a little too much for my son's liking. All in all, worth checking out if you haven't tried before!"
"Ordered Spicy Mentai Chicken bowl and Mentai Salmon bowl, both under the price of $10. I have to say, it's definitely worth the amount spent. The amount of mentaiko sauce provided was so generous and service was great! Looking forward to recommend this place to my friends and family. :)"
"Thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Mentai-Ya @ Tampines this week, where I had their unagi don and shared their mentaiko fries with a friend. Highly recommended for anyone who loves mentaiko! :)"
"Simple, no frills, straight up fried chicken with mentai sauce. Service was fast during lunch time. However chicken breast fillet is used so it will rather dry. I believe chicken thigh will be better combo. $7.80 is definitely worth every buck."
Affordable mentaiko salmon donburi - go for the spicy mentaiko!! Spicy chicken mentaiko is great as well
"Love it. Serving of mentai is more generous than other similar eateries i tried. Spicy mentai soft shell crab is too spicy for me, but they are flexible and offered me the non spicy version. Its quite popular so be prepared to wait a wee bit for your food! Good things come to those who wait."
"Ordered the unagi don, soft shell crab don and mentai fries. Do come give it a try as definitely unique food located in a neighbourhood setting!"
Awesome spicy mentaiko salmon don. Finished it quickly but the portion was ample.
"Have been eating the Chicken Katsu Don about once every week since the opening of the Tampines outlet. The middle section of the chicken katsu can be a little on the dry side but overall dish is still pretty good.

Considering that it's pretty affordable for such a dish (Tamago-En's at ~$14 and this at ~$7), I have to say that it's definitely one of the best hawker chicken katsu don I've eaten.

Have eaten this just yesterday and I guess I'll see you again next week :)"
"I'm a big lover of mentaiko. Mentai-ya gives a super thick layer of mentaiko sauce on both the Salmon and Chicken Don, the only two things i've tried so far. For fans of salmon, the Salmon Mentai Don is an absolute must-try. Although the prices may be a little steep at 7.80 for the chicken and 8.80 for the salmon, compared to your conventional kopitiam fare, it is worth every cent."
Great Mentaiko Mayo-based Japanese dishes. Slightly pricey for a stall located in a coffeeshop but also a rare find for quality Japanese comfort food in the heartlands!
"I like salmon so saw this from a food ordering app and ordered food here like twice (or thrice I cannot remember already). I really like the salmon mentai don especially when matched with the mayonnaise. And the rice is well cooked for my preference. When it reaches home, it is still newly cooked and warm, which is nice. ?? Will definitely order more in the future.

Keep up the good work. ?"
"Ordered spicy salmon mentai don and the normal one. Sauce was too sweet but nonetheless, salmon was well cooked. Delicious. Will order again or just drop by to dabao ??"
I have ordered several times since the tampines outlet open. The portion and price is reasonable. Although my daughter is not a fan of mentai but she is a fan of the chicken katsu don. Looking forward to more variety in future. Kudos to the team!
"Ordered salmon mentai don and tamago mentai yaki on 28 August via grab food delivery for dinner. The portion is good, price is very reasonable and tasted yummy. Am a satisfied customer :)"
"Not really a fan of mentai-dons, but yo man the chicken katsudon is amazeballs! Every mouthful of the mirin-dashi-sauce-coated-rice just hits the right spot. Honestly just the rice is good enough for me.

Btw, for those dining-in, they only provide disposable bowls so do bring along your own container and utensils. I would eat more often if they switched to non-disposables for dining-in. Big hint!"
"Looks good , but honestly doesn’t worth the price or hype , 7.80 for a chicken cutlet with rice is way too over price , 4.80 for mentako fries is also way too overpriced due to the sauce is very little. Would recommend to go Genki sushi instead.

You can try once but won’t return again #notworth #eatsomethingelse #feelcheated"
Enjoyed my lunch here with some specials and unique food for a neighbourhood environment. Good experience.
"Ordered salmon and chicken mentai-Ya. The rice and salmon and fish felt so full of mayonnaise in the mentai sauce that after the 3rd spoonful, it couldn’t be stomach any longer.

Completely different from the ones found at Japanese restaurants. There is very little fish roe in the mental. Utterly disappointing"
1st time tried the spicy mentai salmon and quite like it but find that the portion is rather small. However for the 2nd time I ordered the spicy mentai chicken and mentai fried. I was disappointed to find that the fries are white and soggy. I was expecting golden brown and crispy fried. Was suppose to share the fries with my nephew but my nephew has 1 bite and ewww at it.
I've always love mentaiko dishes. And here they serve it at an affordable price.
"First time try, order mentai fries and spicy mentai soft shall crab, unique food located at neighborhood.
The staff their are friendly, a girl by the name of Susan recommended and explained the food to me. Definitely will come back for more."
"Affordable Mentaiko place! I had the Mentaiko salmon and spicy Mentaiko soft shell crab :) Super generous with their portions and value-for-money, definitely will drop by again."
Really generous with the amount of mentaiko!! They gave a big piece of salmon as well????
"I have personally tried it before and it’s really nice. Given the price and the ingredients they give, it’s really worth the money. Highly recommended.

Photo by Neighbor."
Pretty greasy but generous with the mentai and the spicy mentai was good too
"Food was good and very tasty! Affordable mentaiko Japanese food, the mentaiko fries were good and the spicy mentaiko was not too spicy or salty. Very nice meal"
"Affordable pricing, convenience and my daughter loves having the chicken katsu rice with tamago ????

My comfort food after a long day or busy week."
Good food good service good mentaiko. Ordered spicy salmon mentaiko don
"Food: Awesome
Customer service: Awesome
Overall: Hell yeah it's good
Ordered: Salmon Mental Don"
"Food is absolutely fabulous, better value and taste than a certain rather expensive and not worth japanese food stall in Simpang Bedok.

Will eat again later!"
"1. Super Affordable & delicious
2. 100% mentai satisfying
3. 100% Recommend to those food hunters looking for good food!!!

Definitely will comeback for more of Mentai Chicken and salmon !!"
Ordered chicken katsu don. Ate half and threw the rest away. Worst meal I ever had. I think 7eleven microwave food taste better than this.
Good service from the shop! Made an error of ordering at the wrong outlet and the shop assisted to make the order despite the busy dinner time and informed the other outlet about the mishap to cancel. Of cuz the food is yummy :)
Ordered through food panda. Very fast and delicious
Food is nice but pricey for kopi tiam
Ordered Spicy Salmon Mentai Don & Chicken Katsu Don. Taste good and great value for money. I will definitely visit again!!!
"Placed an order with them on Foodpanda, and they canceled my order 55mins later."
Good price and service. Multiple ordering platforms. Love their salmon don!
No good less portion and very exp??disappointed
Its such a delicious meal that i ever taken at this resonable price ...mentai suace was so addicted definitely will order again  !!
Price of the salmon mentai is reasonable. Service staff is excellent
Generous portion of mentaiko and chicken. A bit too jelak towards the end.
"Really nice food at an affordable price, place is clean and good air ventilation."
Great food and service they offered. Nice food option available in neighbourhood area. Thanks for opening
Well worth the trip from the other side of Tampines to have the food here!
"Will be back for more ?? Delicious, value for money too"
Generous serving of salmon and price is very affordable too!
Good price varieties of dish to choose
"Affordably Priced ,huge portions and amazing food."
I ordered the spicy salmon mentai don which cost $8.80. It is flavourful and the mentaiko sauce is not over powering which is a plus!! highly recommend this place if you live near ????
Tried thé mentaiko chichen katsu and the meat is smooth like butter sia! And the mentaiko is not very heavy and the rice is good too. I’ll come back here to try the curry chicken katsu??
"We tried their chicken mentai rice bowl and the unagi egg rice bowl, and was pleasantly surprised by how succulent the chicken cutlet was. The mentai mayo sauce was not overly rich and complemented the cutlet nicely.

Very happy to welcome Mentai-Ya to our neighbourhood!"
"I was quite excited when this japanese stall opened at my place.  Went for the chicken and salmon mentai. First of all kudos to the person who cooked the rice today, 25 dec.  Perfect rice ! I had this initial fear that the mentai sauce might be too overwhelming. But it turned out to be subtle and not overly saltish. Love it. Although the salmon is not dry I still prefer the crispy chicken."
Super yummy and worth the price
Good taste and reasonable portions.
"So so food, a bit x though......"
"Always a 5-star experience I’m here! (Will give 6-star if I could).

A quaint little stall in the corner to the coffee shop, serving honest, generously-portioned and tasty food!

Service was sincere and AWESOME. You could see the lady earnestly thanking and wishing the food delivery riders a happy new year etc. What great positivity and upbringing!

I’ll definitely return ??

The stall accepts own container when doing takeout ?? so start bringing ur own containers to reduce waste now ??"
"Affordable mentaiko bowl. Thick chicken piece. A nice piece of salmon. Rice is nice and fluffy with your typical japanese sauce from neighborhood hawker Japanese stall. Tamagoyaki pretty normal but a comfortable side dish. Ordered the spicy mentaiko and it is a good level of spicy, definitely less spicy than a mcspicy. Wish there were some veggies in the bowl to balance out the nutrition. Overall a good experience."
Had the Spicy Mentaiko Salmon Don and it did not dissapoint! The serving of salmon was quite generous and the spicy mentaiko sauce was really good. Very reasonably priced for the quantity and quality!
"Really one of the best mentaiko I have tasted. Chicken mentaiko was at a very affordable $7.80 and had a good serving of rice. Chicken was thick but not that big and juicy like I was expecting. Nonetheless, very much worth the trip down to this quaint stall. Good news is that they recently opened at Sengkang too!"
"Delicious. Generous portions! Ordered via Foodpanda and each dish cost $2 more. But I guess for the comfort & convenience, it is worth it especially if there's a voucher or credit card discount."
"New stall that my neighbour introduced so dropped by for a try.

Stall owners were courteous and friendly to start with. 1 star. I did a takeaway understanding that food wouldn’t taste as great after reaching home that was 20 mins away. To my surprise I was wrong! Tori Karaage was still hot and crispy though a little hard but the 4 huge pieces made it all worth while. They were well marinated too. Another star added.

The gyoza were to die for let me tell you guys. Usually they would be soft and soggy for takeaways but no. They were still as hot and crispy as though I was eating there. Trust me, I am not lying. The slightly sour dark sauce made them so tasty that I regretted buying only 1 serving! Aarrrhhhh....but adding another star.

Last is the salmon mentai don. Fish was thick and pretty large. Texture was a little hard but still acceptable. I requested for more rice and I think because of that, they didn’t add enough sauce to the rice. Could be more generous but I guess at that price I’m paying, I’ll be too mean if I don’t give any stars. Last one added, making it a 4-star to this little corner stall.

Will definitely not be my only patronage there. Well done for a start!"
"Value for money, I really love mentaiko hence I enjoyed the mentaiko salmon don and fries, as generous servings of mentaiko sauce was given. Food was served pretty fast too. Convenient location, will definitely visit again!"
"The Mentaiko sauce was plenty and flavorful. Portions were just nice for adults. Price is OK. Well ran by youths who were very polite and helpful.

Edit: went back again to pickup for lunch, was pleasantly surprised when they offered a free side to apologise for my wrong order previously. Was only a slight mistake, but for them to admit it and offer something for my return visit speaks much about these youths. Keep it up!"
"Mentai-ya is located inside kopitiam.

Real life don looks different from what was advertised in mothership. The photo from mothership looks more appetizing tho and was what initially made me went down to try.

Ordered both mentai salmon and mentai katsu as the name says Mentai. Mentaiko sauce given was generous.

Preferred the mentai katsu more as the salmon was rather dry.

My personal rating for the mentai katsu don: 7/10, and 5/10 as for the mentai salmon.

Visited on 24 Aug 2020"
"Order the chicken for around 8 dollars. Chicken portion is tiny but tasty. Alot of rice. Mentaiko sauce comes in spicy or non spicy flavours. I got the spicy one and it was not too spicy. Price point is expensive but the quality can match with some Japanese restaurants despite being located in a coffee shop. Bad point is that it's quite far away from the nearest mrt, bp mrt. So might have to walk 15mins or take bus. Will I come back again? Just the slightly ulu location alone, probably no. But worth a try though."
"No queue on Sunday lunch time, so decided to try it.

- portion of the food is small
- I find the price is pricy for the quality and portion
- they added to much water into the rice, so the rice becomes too sticky...

no wonder the hype is over."
"Finally had a chance to try, when they first open was pretty much sold out or super long que. waited awhile for the food, consider reasonable waiting time. Ordered Chicken Katsu don and Spicy Chicken mentai don. Honestly I’m happy with it. As the chicken pieces are generous and thick. Was juicy and tender. As a lot of chicken katsu don are usually thin and dry. Mentai sauce was good and spicy enough. Overall happy with the food. Pardon, forget to take pic. Will be back again, thank you and keep it up. ??"
"$4.80 for this portion, not worth it. Taste wise is just ok."
"What a surprise find, a stall tuck inside a HDB Kopitiam in Senja Bukit Panjang. Love the salmon mentai don! Yummy :) Tori karaage and unagi Tama don is great too! If you can't travel there to buy, let grabfood or deliveroo do it for you (be aware price is higher on the delivery apps)."
"Salmon Mentai Don - Flavourful mentaiko sauce with decent portions of rice and salmon. Salmon size has shrunk? since stall opening but it could be my luck.

Chicken Mentai Don - Value for money, delicious and well fried chicken cutlet with mentaiko sauce, will fill your stomach.

Gyoza - Crispy and delicious.

Chicken Karaage - Crispy and well fried although abit too salty for my tastebuds.

I normally don't post food reviews online, but i am sending some moral support after your establishment is being unfairly slandered by a competitor.

You serve delicious food, and your staff treats both customers and food delivery riders with equal courtesy and attention. I would know, as i am also a part-time delivery rider as well and have collected orders before from your stall. Glad to see that your business have expended and keep up the good work!"
Food was alright. Nothing special. Mentaiko was good. Menu items very limited
"Mentai salmon Don and chicken katsu Don are just so so only. As shown in the picture, really just mentai + cooked salmon + rice for $7.80 and the food just not appetising at all. Honestly I rather pay more for a much better quality mentai taste."
Visited Mentai-Ya (BP branch) on 22 Sept & ordered Unagi Tama don. Waiting time took a while but the staff there are hard at work & friendly ^-^ The unagi is tender & juicy; portion of rice is generous enough & served pipping hot to make this meal comforting :D Have yet to try out their signature Salmon Mentai Don but will come by again!
"Queued for 35 mins. Highly recommend the mentaiko salmon as well as the eel don. Although portion was rather small and slightly on the expensive, it was worth the wait"
Ok.. Can't compare to Waa Cow or Japanese restaurants. It's fairly decent still.
"My $9.80 unagi don served is like a soggy porridge, cmi dont know how to cook rice properly"
"If you love mentaiko, this is definitely the place for you! INSANE amounts of mentaiko with great portions and sides, worth the visit for sure."
"Hi I'm muslim, I am unfortunately unable to enjoy nor rate the food.
However I am able to say that their record keeping is very impressive, Their ability to produce receipts is unparalleled. Not to mention, their investigative prowess is top notch! 5/5 Food Store"
Cheaper version of waa cow @ $8.80. But still prefer waa cow
Overdue review but I love the salmon mentai bowl that comes with generous serving of mentai. The only downside is it's a bit far. Hope to see you in Jurong some time later.
Food was not bad. Little salty. Tried the spicy mentai salmon don. Quite spicy. Expect a wait due to many delivery orders.
"Unique to have such a store in a nbh area. However, the price is Abit on the high side and food portion is very small so for big eater, be prepare to spend a bomb!"
"First time trying this stall, Chicken Katsu Don is great and affordable. Definitely worth it. The lady attending to the customers is very nice and friendly too."
Great value for money! Would recommend getting a side to share if you are eating 2 pax!
Nice and addictive dons. My kids dont like fish but like the salmon mentai. Abit pricey tho but worth it.
Cheap and good japanese food.. the mentai sauce is awesome for the price charged
Think the novelty is wearing off - no queue these days. Portion of meat is quite small and don't think it's Japanese rice that they are using in the rice bowls. Not worth a second visit if you are not staying nearby.
"Liked it at first.. Because they gave shredded seaweed to be added into your bowl.. However, halfway through, they stopped providing it. Feedback to one of them that it enhances the flavour.. Instead of taking it constructively, he replied by saying.. ""Without it our food is already delicious."" @@ alright then.. That was my last order. One customer lost."
"Good value, high quality, and great taste! Would recommend to anyone looking for a quick and easy dinner spot"
Delicious food and great service! Food was served promptly and staff were friendly as well. Recommend to try it out! Will head there again :)
"Food is nice but serve very slow, i been waiting for more then 30 minute, may be you can think a method to increase yoyr speed????"
really yummy mentaiko sauce that's not overpowering! plus points for quick and friendly service
"Big fan of mentaiko, highly recommend for all the people staying in the west! Definitely worth every cent of your money, tastes best when you bring your girlfriend down."
"I've never bought anything here, nor have I visited the place.

In light of the current news, I suggest that you make a police report so the culprits can be brought to justice.

In my personal view, there is clearly an offence made after I've read all the evidences that you have gathered."
Run by a nice young couple. I recommend the salmon don and gyoza. Was too hungry to take photos:-)
Like that they use chicken breast for their Katsu!
"it tastes good
The service is good
And it came pretty fast to my house??
It was even on par with the boba tea delivery timing"
"Ate at the senja's stall a couple of days back. The chicken mentaiko bowl tasted great & staff was extremely polite while taking orders. Though my friend & I thought it'll be great if there are add-on sides to the bowl such as extra chicken, egg, etc. Great food overall!"
ive only tried these two dishes. i am big fan of mentaiko so the salmon mentaiko don is really really savoury! they gave good quantity of unagi as well! do give this a try westies!!
"Ordered with two of my friends with different items, came in plastic bowls, food was so dry that in the middle of eating, it was hard to masticate the remaining meat with the rice due to the dryness of it. Would recommend adding a complimentary soup for patrons too. Overrated I feel."
"Ordered the spicy salmon mentai don and even as someone who usually doesn’t eat mentaiko, I really liked it. The rice was cooked well and they were very generous with the sauce too. Was very pleasantly surprised by the mentaiko fries and tamago too, up to par with many Japanese restaurants. Worth the trip down!!!"
"Very well run stall, great service. Mentai portion was generous, chicken katsu thick and flavourful, salmon was soft and juicy. Only thing is that the bowl has no veg, onion, radish, pickles, only has exactly what it was advertised as: rice, teriyaki sauce, meat and mentai. Can feel a bit jelak. Gyoza and chicken karage were very nicely fried."
Bought a chicken mentai-don for takeaway this afternoon at their newly opened sengkang outlet and I am surprise by the generous amount of mentai sauce that was given. Portion of the rice was to my expectation and I love how you can taste both the crispness of the chicken with the mentai sauce in every bite
"I look forward to eating Mentai-ya’s Salmon don at their Sengkang branch every week! The food tastes amazing and the staff are so friendly and helpful. I’ve tried their katsu curry don before as well and it’s rly good. Their Tamago mentai is super yummy too!! now my friends and family love ordering from them :) Thank you so much for your hard work guys, we appreciate it! ???? ????"
"Portion is tiny, taste is great, but not worth the price point"
"Buy from this stall all the time, food is delicious but the portion is getting smaller and smaller."
The food here is disgusting. Salmon that is cooked very badly and served with cold hard rice.
"Overrated, it's no different from any other Japanese restaurant"
Quick and Hassel free craves for a mentaiko Don.
Will be coming back with my friends :) i wish there could be more variety
"For a 45min wait on a weekday afternoon, the food was underwhelming. It wasn't as cheap as one would think. For the same price, you can get a better don at a japanese restaurant.

Was expecting a lot more given the hype generated by Mothership."
"$8.80 salmon mentaiko cannot be any cheaper or nicer, EVEN better than some restaurants. the mentaiko is definitely generous and mentaiko lovers will love, non-mentaiko lover then too bad"
"For the price, the amount of mentai given is pretty much. Only con is the location, not very convenient."
"Raise your hand if you're here to support Mentai Ya????????

After all these, makes me wanna try their food for real!!!!"
food is mediocre.. slightly overpriced..
Not bad. Great mentai sauce.
Its such a delicious meal that i ever taken at this resonable price ...mentai suace was so addicted definitely will prder again??
On the expensive end given that it’s located in neighbourhood Kopitiam. Only customer for that time but took about 10mins to get my food. Portion rather small but mentai sauce generous
Food quality is amazing! Portion is very generous (big portion of salmon!!) and service is very good! Definitely recommend!
good quality at affordable price
Fairly decent for the price. The price is higher than what you would find in kopitiam. Its nice to have once in a while
Portion is on the small side but price is good for what you get. I would suggest getting the chicken as the salmon isn’t the best quality.
Typical kopitam setup. But this stall is new here and drawing long queue and a lot of youngsters. Nice Japanese food at kopitam pricing.
Tasty chicken and sauce. You can ask for no rice (if you are on low carb) and be served with cabbage.
Not so cheap coffeeshop food
"Good price here,try it out"
"showing my support, hope you able to pull thur this.
ganbatte ganbatte ganbatte"
"Good but quite ex, should have complimentary miso soup at least"
Restaurant quality food with the most reasonable price! Staffs are very friendly
Generous Portion and Good Service
"Portion = 4/5
Taste = 4/5
Location = 1/5
Worth? = 3/5"
Its aight you're payijg for mentaiko as a premium
Affordable price for such a good food ??!
Portion is too little and price is on high side. Not worth.
Meat/salmon so dry. Not nice at all
Not worth the hype
Too expensive for kopitiam
service was great. food is okay
Good Affordable  Japanese Food
Very nice mentaiko
Good
Tasty food
Honest business
"(Translated by Google) Pretty good

(Original)
?? ????"
bought 2 sets of chicken katsu curry don and both sets did not come with curry. waste of money. would not recommend this to anybody. >:(
I frequent this place and would recommend all to have their Spicy Salmon Mentaiko Don. Staff working at the stall are extremely friendly and approachable too. A must try if you live especially if you live nearby.
"a bit ex for hawker food but it's nice

i've tried most stuff frm there and there's more than just mentaiko food

edit: i just bought from there and i said no onions bc my young sister is going to eat that but they still gave"
"Affordable and delicious!

Ordered the Salmon Mentai Don and Mentai Fries.

The salmon don was of a good portion and had a generous amount of mentaiko sauce.

Their fries were nicely cooked and had the same or slightly better amount of crisp to it than McDonald's! Was pleasantly surprised with their fries!

Would definitely revisit someday!"
What a pleasant surprise! Affordable but good quality Japanese cuisine in an unassuming coffee shop. The katsu was of good quality with minimal to no fats. The portion of japanese curry was generous and yummy. Do support them!
"As expected the salmon mentai is good.
But 4 stars because I ordered the tamago mentai as a side BUT the tamago was cold, which kinda ruined the good in-house mentai sauce on top. It would be good to have it hot, or at least, give customers RG e option.

The gyoza was really meh, it could be from anywhere."
Try it today ?? the food was not bad .  Honestly I'm mind blown by how a hawker can have some good mentaikio sauce wow this one of the best at punggol . Keep it up ?? and may your business prosper
"Tried the mentaiya chicken don and fries. Tasted good. Very generous with the sauce.
Recommend a try if you like mentaiko sauce."
"Food not in consistent standard. poor service attitude.

Chicken is hard, soft shell crab don’t even have crab taste. salmon was on the hard side.

And plus the lousy service… Haiz…"
"Is my N time taste there food ! It was good, service good too, I really like there mentaiko sauce too much!!!"
Is my first time taste there food ! It was good . I really like there salmon fish very much.??????????
Terrible staff attitude. Do not have the courtesy to inform that item is not available before i went to collect my food. In the end chose something i do not like and came home to know that rice not properly cooked.
Good service provided and as always their spicy salmon mentai don is my favourite and it never disappoints ??
"not too sure where the 5 stars came from, but this place food + service was both bad. like really bad. once is enough for me and my fam."
"will give half a star if i could . staff’s attitude to me was darn bad and the food is expensive, wont recommend to be honest"
is quite bad their attitude.. food is expensive to me as well .. not recommend
"quick stop if in Punggol, service was fast, nice salmon mentai"
????
Will go again
Rejected the order because they do not serve plate. Throw all the deep fried gyoza in a plastic container and expect the guests to eat from it. I'm the customer eating in stall. Shocking.
"Affordable and delicious!

Ordered the Salmon Mentai Don, Mentai Fries, and Spicy Mentai Soft Shell Crab.

The salmon don was of a good portion and had a generous amount of mentaiko sauce.

Unfortunately, their fries were soggy as compared to their punggol outlet which was very crispy and on par with macdonald's fries.

Their Spicy Mentai Soft Shell Crab was really flavorful and had a good amount of meat.
Generally, other soft shell crabs I've had did not have as much meat as theirs.

Would definitely revisit someday!"
Long heard about this and finally tried via delivery app. The rice was generous and the 1 person portion is enough to keep me full. Spicy mentai isn't that spicy but has its flavour. Non spicy option is gd too. Will try other options next time.
"Tried salmon mentaiya. It was great but my son liked it and took most of it. It is good to have good stall around the area. Ordered tamago maki as well, it was ok, nothing special on it. Should have gone for tamago mentai which a bit special maybe.

Will try again next time on another item on the menu. Serving time is ok. Was given a buzzer and just few minutes walk around the area and my order is ready."
"Reasonably priced for the salmon and mentaiko.  $8.80 for a bowl. Will be better if they have like veggie sides to allow for add on.

Overall happy with the food."
"Ordered through Grabfood and then self pick up. Generous amount of mentai sauce, huge plus point for mentai lovers. And can you also see the piece of chicken I have is thick and juicy, not just a thin layer of chicken with batter, but a real chunky meat coated with batter and topped with sauce. A very filing portion with lots of rice too!"
"If you're a fan of all things mentaiko, you'll be in for a ride.
But I personally preferred the soft shell crab curry don as it's not something you see usually and it's at a fraction of the usual price point."
"Yummy Food.
Order via grab.
Unagi Tama was standard.
Mentaiko salmon was classic.
The spicy one much more nicer and flaming hot. More umaminess.
Tamago was sweet and savoury. Delicious.
Soft Shell Crab a bit sad cos not crispy due to delivery but its okay, the mentaiko make up for it.
Mentai Heaven..."
"We had Salmon Mentai Don, Spicy Chicken Mentai Don, Spicy Mentai Soft Shell Crab and Tamago Mentai Yaki. Restaurant standard at reasonable price."
"Tried the spicy chicken Don, Unagi Tama Don, tamago mentai, mentai fries, and all came with very generous serving of mentaiko sauce! Although the chicken was slightly burnt (likely due to the touching of the mentaiko), it was still very tender / moist on the inside, and was very well complimented by the spicy mentaiko sauce. The tamago was also pretty juicy and paired great with the sauce. One downside is even though we were dining in, food were packed in takeout containers. Note: Place closes early and last order is at 830pm."
"Seen this on Grab, so came to try it out. Very friendly owners. The Chicken Mentai Don ($7.80) is super crispy and quite tasty but I think the Katsudon might be better. The Salmon Mentai Don ($8.80) is definitely worth the dollar more. The Mentai dressing is generous and the rice is Japanese rice. So overall, pretty good value."
"Have been to Sengkang and Tampines outlet, quality is consistent. Love the spicy Salmon, simply addictive. Salmon portion is generous. Kids love chicken mentai."
"Heard of the eatery few times about how generous the portion was. Decided to try it out.  Food was not bad, but portion was not really that huge as described.  It would have been value for money then.  The original version has some degree of spiciness.  Should be just right for most.  Spicy version like eating otah."
"Affordable quality Japanese food found in Sengkang coffeeshop. Prices are less than $10. Love their mentaiko speciality. Mentaiko lovers pls try! Even if you do not fancy mentaiko, other available options are good as well. Friendly and polite staffs. Would recommend to try!

** New updated menu with soft shell crab and mentaiko udon!"
"Very value, loads of sauce! Waited >15mins only. Portion size is okay/just right. Will go back again!"
"Ordered the chicken mentai don, spicy salmon don and tamago mentai. Portion was decent but they gave way too much mentai sauce. I understand singaporean kaisu everything also want more but the mentai sauce was so overpowering that i has to scrap it away. But at the price point cant complain, mentai is more mayo then mentai too gelat."
"I think for mentaiko, it's decently priced, but for how the dishes tasted, the stall is quite overpriced. Having mentaiko on top that is not torched at all leaves the a strong raw taste of mayonnaise. The dons were pretty bad but soft shell crab was quite good."
"Newly open today! Tried the spicy salmon mentai don and gyoza. Tastes very good, coffee shop food with restaurant standard. But price is a bit steep given the portion."
I think good food is more than putting rice and meat soaked in sauce
"mentaiko sauce is generous and cashier is friendly, give me discount when I follow Instagram account.
portion is a little small but is reasonable priced.
wish there is a up-size option

ps: eunice ask me to review and give 5 star."
"This has got to be the worst Salmon Mentaiko I have ever tried in my life or even in the entire Singapore. One piece of miserably cooked salmon that has more flour and oil than salmon and topped over a bowl of hard and plain rice, which is doused in chemical sauce. Absolutely disgusting.

The staff at the stall is even clueless when you bring up the matter to them.

NEVER COMING BACK. SINGAPORE’S MOST DISGUSTING SALMON MENTAI YUCK!"
"Tried it 3 times, it’s very consistent in taste, rice, good stuff, not wet, ain’t hard, although could feel it’s on the drier side but when you eat it with the chicken and the spicy mentai, it’s just compliments each other, like a team. Will try salmon the next round."
"Have returned couple of times. Still have cravings for it when I'm up for some mentaiko. Personally prefer the spicy one. Salmon a little dry but I think it's alright, gives abit of crisp."
I have been ordering from this branch almost every week. I really love their mentaiko mayo!! I never get tired of it. Very generous portion and very delicious.
"Ate the mentaiko salmon Don twice, 2 months apart. The rice cooking has improved. The mentaiko is great."
Ordered the Chicken Mentai Don. Chicken is crispy.. overall is quite nice but portion is little so price abit pricy.
Taste better than its looks. Salmon is crispy at the outside and quite tender. Good job! ????
"As a mentaiko lover will always order mentaiko whenever anywhere have mentaiko in their menu out of all the mentaiko i had, mentai ya is the most generous with their mentaiko sauce as shown from pic ???? Don’t mind small portion of salmon as long got more sauce ??"
"I used to like their Dons but ordered again from Grabfood today and seems like the mentaiko sauce’s standard dropped. The sauce was very ‘gelat’, lots of mayonnaise with only slight mentaiko flavour. The rich umami taste of mentaiko was absent"
"Had a takeaway from here. Substandard katsu chicken curry. Watery curry, soggy and tasteless chicken for $8."
Good place to have a delicious bowl of Japanese food . Stay near-by and is extremely convient for me . Would 100/100 recommend to my friends and family.
"I would have given 4 stars for it :)
But because i was observing the guy torching food for 10mins hence one star is taken away. Proper use of food torch should present blue flame and not yellow flame, which means the gas is not fully oxidised and hence may get onto the food i put into my stomach. I suppose its not healthy in the long run? Understand this is a chain of 3 outlets, perhaps the mgmt could consider providing more training to their chefs, for the safety of yr consumers :)"
"i ordered for the first time to try their spicy salmon mentai don and tamago mentai yaki, omg it is quite good and i really love their food!! even though the portion is small but still enough for me and still it taste amazing."
"Foods not bad, but portion too small. Not enough (I m small eater), no miso soup or pickle, quite expensive."
ate at the waterway outlet and the food + service was very bad. once is enough for me and my fam . not recommended . try meisuke nearby instead
"Good to see these type in kopitiam, food slightly above average! Thank you youngsters!! Keep up the good work"
Ordered Mentaiko Chicken don. The chicken was crispy and the food was delicious.
Awesome mentaiko chicken. The chicken meat was juicy and soft. Very surprising honestly to see this high standard of a mentaiko chicken don in a heartland like Seng Kang
Bought the chicken mentai don. Fed my hamster and he didn't like it. So I gave 1 star. Tks
Never eaten here. But I'm against unethical business behavior. So yea. Do better.
Decent food but the price is too expensive for this portion.
Good mentaiko. Very solid for price. Chicken was moist and tender. Recommend ??
"Summary. Will I go again? Highly unlikely.
First of all... the rice was super wet. It’s almost like congee. Unagi has a super fishy taste indicating that the unagi is not fresh at all. Chicken was under “fried” and tasteless. Salmon was also quite meh...  Tamago was nice but it’s clearly not made by them.

One can easily buy the same ready cooked items from Donki and put them together and blow torching and will prob get something better.

Food is priced slightly under neighborhood restaurants but the food is below par from hawker standards."
"Rice is soggy and salmon is slightly dry, otherwise is ok."
"rating in advance for my future visit, must be very delicious ????"
My takeaway meal ?
The service response is really bad. Have been tried calling for past 1hr wanted to placed order for collection later timing but no one pick up call!!!
I have not tried your food as I stay in the west but I will try this weekend.
Generous portion. Mentaiko is a bit on the saltier side but generally really good!
"quite good taste, price is okay also, and quick service."
Staying near the area and don't know what to eat? Try the salmon don
Mentai-ya is nice.
Eunice sends her regards.
Their salmon definitely generous in the size with lots of mentaiko on top
It would be understandable if you are unable to finish all the mentaiko cream
Japanese rice served with Crispy Chicken top
The mentai don is pretty decent
The serving of salmon was quite generous and the spicy mentaiko sauce was really good
The portion of salmon was really decent and the amount of mentaiko paste given was way more than enough for the meal
The salmon was not really that tender but still not too bad
Dons and fries were priced reasonably considering the amount of mentaiko added
INSANE amounts of mentaiko with great portions and sides
The portions were generous and the salmon with the mentaiko sauce tasted rich and gooood
Just a small kick that goes well with the mentaiko)
We were honestly quite surprised at how generous the portion was for only $10 (excl
Very (very very very) generous with the mentaiko sauce
Their fish is more tender than Donya's which can be a little dry at times
Grilled Salmon topped with a thick layer of flame torch mentaiko over sticky rice drizzled in soy sauce
Salmon skin was crisp and meat was tender
Sweetness of it was just right
They look the same but Mentai Ya's mentaiko sauce is milder compared to Donya's
"Food was good and very tasty! Affordable mentaiko Japanese food, the mentaiko fries were good and the spicy mentaiko was not too spicy or salty. Very nice meal"
"Super affordable Mentaiko place! I had the Mentaiko salmon and spicy Mentaiko soft shell crab. They were so generous with their portions of salmon and mentaiko! It was also my first time trying soft shell crab with spicy mentaiko, it was interesting :)"
"Ordered Spicy Mentai Chicken bowl and Mentai Salmon bowl, both under the price of $10. I have to say, it's definitely worth the amount spent. The chicken and salmon were really fresh! If you're concerned with the spice level of the spicy mentaiko sauce, be rest assured that there is a kick of spice, but definitely not too spicy. The amount of mentaiko sauce and portion of the meal provided was so generous and service was great! Looking forward to recommend this place to my friends and family. :)"
"Great place to satisfy mentaiko cravings, very affordable. Had the mentaiko salmon and spicy mentaiko fried chicken. Mentaiko mayo was really good and the heat in the spicy mentaiko made it better."
Never would have expect such great tasting mentai dish in a coffeeshop! The spicy or regular mentai is both great and the meats tasted great when paired with the mentaiko! 100% I'll be a returning customer (especially when its so near me! Yay!)
"I canâ€™t believe the mentaiko here is so good!! I love how the perfectly fried chicken goes with mentaiko - this is heaven in a bite. You canâ€™t find this quality at this price point anywhere else, highly recommend!"
Absolutely loved the thick and creamy spicy mentaiko sauce they have here! Really recommend trying out the Spicy Salmon Mentai!!
Great value and tasty food! I had the unagi tama don and the mentaiko soft shell crab but i forgot to take a pic of that one. I'm gonna get the salmon next time I'm in the east!
Good food good service good mentaiko. Ordered spicy salmon mentaiko Don and soft shell crab w mentaiko
"Located at a relatively new neighbourhood. Menu is interesting, especially for Mentai lovers. Do check out this place!"
Unique dishes in a neighbourhood setting. Got the soft shell crab and unagi bowl. There is a variety of other side dishes as well!
Love the flavour of the mentaiko here - sweet and tangy! Had the spicy salmon and mentaiko fries. The spicy salmon comes with the right level for spice for spice lovers and also the portion of the salmon cutlet is very value for money!
Very worth for its price! Highly recommend this place :). The portions were generous and the salmon with the mentaiko sauce tasted rich and gooood.
"Yearning to try something new in Bukit Panjang and we chanced upon Mentai-Ya on Grab Food. After reading about the positive reviews online, we decided to give their mentai salmon don a try! We were honestly quite surprised at how generous the portion was for only $10 (excl. delivery charges). The portion of salmon was really decent and the amount of mentaiko paste given was way more than enough for the meal. In fact, it was bordering on the excessive, and it would be understandable if you are unable to finish all the mentaiko cream. That being said, this is one of the more affordable mentai-dons out there!"
"Had lunch here for 2 pax! We got the Salmon Mentai Don, Unagi Don and Mentai Fries. Very tasty and value for money - would highly recommend. Was not a fan of mentaiko sauce before this but the Mentai Fries made me a convert!! ??"
Had the Spicy Mentaiko Salmon Don and it did not dissapoint! The serving of salmon was quite generous and the spicy mentaiko sauce was really good. Very reasonably priced for the quantity and quality!
"Good value, high quality, and great taste! Would recommend to anyone looking for a quick and easy dinner spot"
"Feature Spicy Chicken Mentai Don.
Japanese rice served with Crispy Chicken top, torched with generous spicy mentaiko (not overwhelmed the spiciness, just a small kick that goes well with the mentaiko).
??$7.8
Ps : any recommendations for bukit panjang food ? Please share to me ??. I'm starting explore bukit panjang now.
??Mentai-Ya.
628 Senja Road."
"Really affordable Japanese food located conveniently near a bus stop. Generous servings of mentaiko, dons and fries were priced reasonably considering the amount of mentaiko added. Will definitely visit again!"
"Hidden in Kopitiam along Senja Road there’s this affordable Japanese food stall selling their mentaiko don.

Their salmon definitely generous in the size with lots of mentaiko on top. Go for the spicy sauce to increase the taste."
"Costs about ~$12 excluding delivery charges from grabfood, very (very very very) generous with the mentaiko sauce, more than enough for the whole don. The salmon was not really that tender but still not too bad. Overall pretty enjoyable meal

8/10
"
"??Hidden in a kopitiam in bukit panjang, the mentai don is pretty decent. The mentaiko that slightly torched and melted on the salmon or chicken katsu, bring the umami taste of the dish.
It can be better if the sauce on the rice to be balanced in a good amount.

"If you love mentaiko, this is definitely the place for you! INSANE amounts of mentaiko with great portions and sides, worth the visit for sure."
mentaiko sauce overload but I'm not complaining. very filling to the point of almost jerlat. rice can be more moist. teriyaki sauce can be more generous.
"J is a big fan of the salmon mentaiko don from @donyasingapore.

We were therefore keen to check out Mentai-Ya in (nearish) Seng Kang which specializes in the same dish.

Visual-wise, they look the same but Mentai-Ya's mentaiko sauce is milder compared to Donya's. However, their fish is more tender than Donya's which can be a little dry at times. It is slightly smaller in terms of portions as well.

If you prefer stronger flavours, Donya is probably the better bet but if you like something a little milder, do give @mentaiyasingapore a shot."
"Just for the bite. Not so crispy by the time it arrived but nonetheless, its still pretty tasty. Thanks to the mentaiko. Haha.

Food not in consistent standard. And poor service attitude.
Good quality with reasonable price.
Nice food. Reasonable price
"Mentai sauce was too thick and over whelming. Very ""jerlak"" after a few mouthfuls. Doesn't help that the rice was too mushy and soft.. not sticky like how good quality Jap rice is supposed to be.."
teresa chris cmik toh guan wei
food ok but the service is terrible at SK and woodlands outlets.
"Visited the Tampines outlet for the first time and I must say Iâ€™m very impressed. I bought spicy salmon mentaiko, chicken katsu curry don and mentaiko fries.

Even after long ride home, the fries taste superb. The katsu was surprisingly very tender and not the usual crusty hard chicken. Spicy mentaiko was cream of the crop.

Superb, keep it up!"
"Food is very nice , highly recommended keep up the standard ! Will support again ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ» punggol new branch"
The rice is too soggy wet even for dine in :/
not worth it. the chicken could be better
Visited Sengkang branch. Female staff were very friendly. Love the food. Value for money
Been pratronizing the tampines outlet for awhile. food are always consistent and good. never disappoint.
Love the chicken katsu don and mentai tamago! Always have a hard time deciding what to order cos everything is so good! ðŸ˜‹

I always enjoy having their meals, especially when I have cravings for jap food. Please keep up the good work and standard of your food! Will definitely continue to support!"
"best jap cuisine in sengkang.
however one thing they need to improve on their mentaiko fries. The fries too tiny in size, not very shiok."
Food is awesome! Lots of mentai sauce
Crazy good be it its spicy or regular mentai! Well cooked salmon that isnt dry! 10/10 would return once more!
"Top quality Mentai Don!!
Very very nice!!
Worth driving 15mins to get them!
Had the Chicken Mentai Don and Spicy Salmon Mentai Don!"
Really like the flavour of the mentaiko and portion of the food is value for money! I had the spicy salmon mentaiko and am very happy with the spice level (im a spice lover) ðŸ˜€
"Deliciously, creamy mentaiko that pairs perfectly with a crispy, yet juicy, chicken cutlet! I was really impressed by how good the meal was, especially at this price point. It isnâ€™t greasy or jelak like other places. Highly recommend!"
The food tasted absolutely phenomenal and was worth itâ€™s super affordable price! I loved their mentai fries and recommend everyone to give their menu a shot:)
Wouldnâ€™t expect to find such nice yet affordable Japanese food at the foot of a HDB block! Really recommend the spicy salmon mentai and mentai fries here.
"I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Mentai-Ya @ Tampines this week, where I had their unagi don and shared their mentaiko fries with a friend. Highly recommend it for anyone who loves mentaiko :)"
Great value and tasty food! I had the unagi tama don  and the mentaiko soft shell crab but i forgot to take a pic of that one. I'm gonna get the salmon next time I'm in the east!
Good food good service good mentaiko. Ordered spicy salmon mentaiko don
Value for money and fair portion size. Looking forward to trying other items from the menu
"Tasty and affordable, the portion size was also great! There are also nice sides to choose from"
"Nice food, great value and generous serving."

Best in the west. Yummy and delicious
Delicious Japanese mentaiko donburi in the heartland delivered by Foodpanda.  Very generous portions.
"First try out of Mentai-Ya, overall really love the chicken mental Don.  Will definite recommend friend to come for a try. 
The only item missing are, if thereâ€™s soup to come along with the set. It will be perfect. 
Hope to see changes, if I happen to visit again. ***** 5 star"
Nice salmon and chicken mentai don
Great value for money! Chicken Katsu don is delicious! Great staff running the stall too!
"Order Spicy mentaiko chicken through foodpanda from the Fernvale Outlet. Was actually mind-blown for the price. Although it was chicken breast, it was godamn tender and the spicy mentaiko was bombz. 
Highly recommended :)"
"Tried the Chicken mentai and salmon mentai at sengkang branch. Definitely value for money and more importantly, it is delicious! Being a japanese cuisine lover, the chicken katsu is solid when matched with the mentaiko sauce! And the portion is right for a big eater like me! The rice given was generous too! 

The staff was not only polite and patience in serving me but also took the time to highlight the specialty they have!

Will definitely head over again!

"Good Salmon Mentai Don carefully prepared in an HDB coffee stop setting. Incredibly cheap at less than $10. Ideal when you are looking for a quick, convenient and cheap Japanese meal. Highly recommended. Bear in mind This isn't a Michelin starred high end fine cuisine. If you expect this level of taste at the price, see a psychiatrist instead :-)"
Love their Salmon Mentai Don that I would travel down to have it â¤ï¸ Definitely worth every calories and thank you guys for all the hard work !ðŸ¥°
Great food. i love how the mentaiko have the bits of the egg roll that will burst in your mouth! highly recommened the pork cutlet. rare to find mentaiko pork cutlet with mentaiko around the west side :p
"Went to the Fernvale outlet last week. Food portion was huge, quality was there. Definitely worth the try!"
"The portion of the Mentaiko Don is extremely generous, and the food is prepared piping hot which adds to the experience. Very value for money for a premium dish.

Not to forget the staff who are extremely courteous in serving you. Overall pleasant disposition, in a nicely renovated yet humble store tucked in a corner of Sengkang."
"This is coming from someone who donâ€™t eat Mentai at all after being introduced to it at Saizeryia and Genki Sushi due to the â€œfishyâ€ taste of Mentai. However, after eating at Mentai-Ya, I grew to love the Mentai sauce, especially, the spicy Mentai. The fact that the sauce is torched before serving makes the sauce more fragrant and eliminates the â€œfishyâ€ taste as well. As of now, I only eat the Mentai from this store as it has appealed to my tastebuds. Highly recommended!"
"Went to this newly opened Mentai Ya in Sengkang, and give a shot to try their mentaiko katsu and salmon don. Was very disappointed with:

1. The rice: we know that the Japanese rice are known to be mushy-texture but if you cook with too much water, it will become â€œba-zhang gluttonousâ€ rice. This rice was served to me and I went back and gave this feedback to the chef, but was greeted with ignorant attitude and replied, â€œthe rice is like that one..â€

2. The quantity of rice is way below expectation. 

3. We order Salmon and Fried Chicken. The quality of Salmon is poor and the fried chicken is just ok. 

4. Mentai-Ko sauce is ok. But to be brutally honest, you can buy this sauce easily in Don Don Donki.

Conclusion: if you are hungry, donâ€™t expect this to fill your stomach. Price paid is not justifiable.

Feedback to the chef, please cook the rice with pride. It is a critical part of this dish. The rice is â€œNOT like this oneâ€. 

Overall is disappointed."
Delicious! Donâ€™t really eat mentaiko much but itâ€™s really nice! Affordable too! Highly recommended to give it a try :) will be coming again although I donâ€™t stay nearby! Worth the travel :)
"was looking forward to try mentai ya in sengkang. ordered via grabfood and food does arrive relatively hot /warm. however was disappointed with the mentaiko sauce, which is jelat due to high mayo content. rice is normal chinese rice which lack of the overall combination with the japanese style chicken/salmon mentai, didnt blend in well together. so overall, wont try it again."
i had spicy salmon today. it nice but the portion is too little.
"Overpriced, please reduce price by 20%. Food taste so-so only. i would not eat again."
"Really delicious! Finally got to try your dishes and they are such a warm embrace on a cold, rainy Monday such as this. Will definitely order more soon. Thank you!"
The food itâ€™s nice and affordable! ðŸ˜
"Random hawker date night and canâ€™t believe came across amazing Japanese food!  Simple menu, hawker prices, restaurant quality and a tiger promo girl in the centre makes for a fab evening!"
Overpriced secondary school canteen food. Not worth the wait and hype over it.
"Rice too hard, not taste like Japanese  rice.
Limited choices. 
 Due to over respond n long Q?"
"I think the menu was slightly different as compared to the previous tenryu dining. tenryu dining had good value, good food for sure. (I'll rate it a good 8-9 out of 10)

But the new mentai-ya shop's standard was just too average(rate it 5/10 for their unagi don). definitely not worth the long queue. 

wouldn't go again even if there's no queue."
The restaurant is no more in operation. Closed 3 weeks ago
"Terrible food and Super over priced .. Self claimed it's ""residents price"".. but prices same as any other Japanese restaurants in downtown .. aircon in ceiling is leaking water.. dripping all over food and table ..."
Affordable Japanese food in the West! Each slice of sashimi is rather thick as well â˜ºï¸
"Just came back from an extremely good meal at Tenryu with my family. We found it on google because it had the highest rating in the vicinity (Bukit Panjang/Choa Chu Kang area) for good reason! My dad is usually a picky eater, but even he had nothing but compliments. It's a humble restaurant set within a residential area that's super chill and quaint. The staff were extremely courteous and friendly, and even went out of the way to help my brother (who arrived later) find his way in. My only issue is that the place was difficult to find at first. But I had a very pleasant experience and will definitely return! Highly recommend! :)"
Salmon and garlic fried rice ï¿½ ï¿½ overall food is good ï¿½ thankful for the kind understanding from the boss!
Nice food..cozy place ....reasonable price and good service..
Had dinner together with my family yesterday evening. It was my first time and the taste of the food is still within my expectations. Goyza a bit too oily and saba set is warm. I preferred more warmer... quality and quantity is still acceptable. Staffs are polite. Will go again with friends this time.
