"Bought the Mentaiko Salmon Bowl, Unagi Toji Don, Mentaiko Fries and Lok Lok.

All are very tasty! The Lok Lok sticks are deep fried version and very crispy even though takeaway. Salmon and unagi portion are good. Mentaiko fries also remain crispy after some time.

Definitely will purchase again!"
"Was looking forward to try this, but got super shocked at this outrageous shaoxing braised pork bowl. Expected to have egg per the picture in the menu but only got meat+rice. Couldve gotten more from my $5 at a caifan stall w rice+meat+others. Not going to go back again"
"Ordered the lok lok and requested to go with the rice ($5.50), so technically its a ""lok lok rice bowl"" which you can see from the picture.

All items are well fried and goes well with the sauce, broccoli is very well fried especially.

Rice is well cooked too

Suggest to have something sourish to offset the jelat-ness as it is all fried items.
Maybe lemon sauce, pickled radish or ginger would be good.

Variety of the lok lok can be more.

Price is reasonable as lok lok is at $1 each"
"Have been wanting to try and finally I did. My sons loved the Salmon Don so much. I had the Garlic Pork Belly and it was awesome. Going back to try the rest on the menu and I'm sure it will never be disappointing. From Leo to Alvin, thanks a bunch bro. ?? you soon"
"Amazing find at a coffee shop. They serve different type of bowls and loklok.
Salmon mentai bowl was good for coffee shop standard and Lok Lok was fried well."
"Value for money. On first look, the bowls look small but itís really packed with goodness as you start eating. Portions just nice

I ordered unagi toji and kicap manis pork belly bowl. Just a suggestion, owner might want to reduce the sauce on the rice as it gets salty towards the end"
"Food was OK but I'm totally disappointed with their takeaway nonsense. U don't charge an additional of 20¢ for 2 sticks of lok lok in a doggy bag. I was a regular buying loklok as snack food everytime I am nearby, usually 3-6 sticks. Yesterday I bought 2 bcos the selections wasn't there. And u have the cheek to charge me an additional 20¢ for doggy bag?? I wasn't even charged for the past mo ths. This is shameful to do business like that
Up your loklok price to do a decent business. Not charging a doggy bag like that. Leaves a distaste in my mouth."
"Had the beef bowl and unagi toji bowl recently. Beef slices were tough, unagi was not very tender either. Had to wait more than 30mims during off peak hours because there was only 1 staff handling 4 orders (2 for the customer before me and my 2 orders), seems too long."
"Ordered mentaiko chicken bowl and the chicken served was totally uncook inside. Return to the store and took super long to serve. When asked, they have not even re-prepared it. Very bad and not apologetic. Asked for refund in the end. Beef and mushroom bowl was so so as well. Do not recommend at all."
Ordered the garlic pork belly rice bowl and chose the spicy option. Pork belly portion was generous and the overall taste of the dish was fantastic for the price. Friendly and polite young owner as well. Will definitely be back to try his other rice bowls and Lok Lok!
"Lok Lok is tasty ! Price is reasonable.

Staff is friendly as well.

Waiting time is abit long thou."
"The $8.50 Mentaiko Salmon rice bowl was way worth for the generous portion it came in with mentaiko sauce all over. Owner also gave a free onsen egg. So far I've also tried the Garlic Pork Belly rice bowl for a cheap $5, and again the portion of garlic pork was generous. The also sell Lok Lok there each stick for only $1, I like the brocolli loklok best and also for the sauce they used. Totally recommend ppl in tampines to give this a try at least once."
"Amazing salmon mentaiko donburi! Was pleasantly surprised that the salmon was well cooked and still tender with a generous amount of mentaiko sauce. Most cooked salmon that Iíve tried at hawkers are normally over cooked and very flaky.

The portion was great as well, a great bang for your buck. Wouldíve preferred if there were a few more slices of vegetables in my bowl."
"Came here to try with friends. We love the mentaiko salmon, garlic pork and mentaiko chicken! Food was delicious, itís nice to find adorable dons in neighbourhood areas. Would love to come and try their loklok next time ??"
"Their lok lok is at least edible. I could say is way better than bedok 85 lok lok. But frankly speaking, they have limited edition to choose. Overall I would grade them 8/10."
"Nice food
Freshly done
Taste 5/5
Orientation 5/5
Waiting time 5/5

I recommend this to anyone that loves to taste a new style of dish. Delicious and freshly made."
Been enthusiastic to try this after reading it online. Went over and find the shop unfriendly service for ordering. Likely due to short of manpower with 1 single lady. Will not be back again.
I was lost in life and every looked so hopeless till I chanced upon this place.  The food gave me a new hope
Very tasty donburi  at great prices.
Yummy rice bowl. Friendly stallholder.
The rice bowl is sicck. The lok lok is cheap and great as well!
"Came here to try with friends, we love the mentaiko salmon, garlic pork and mentaiko chicken dons! It‚Äôs nice to find affordable dons in a neighbourhood area. Would come back and try the lok lok another time üòä"
"Dropped by to get loklok & their garlic pork rice bowl. The most crucial part of loklok is its pairing sauce which the owners of Sticks N Bowls did a great job on. Worth the visit, will return for sure!"

"Awesome experience. Ordered for my girl‚Äôs birthday and the owner is superbly sweet! Food is great too. I ordered the lok lok, satay, braised pork Don and unagi Don. Very delicious! Cheaper than grabfood, just order direct from them! Highly recommended !"
Tasty food with reasonable prices. I like the sauce for the rice and the mentaiko üëçüèº
"Ordered mentaiko chicken bowl and the chicken served was uncook fr inside. Return to the store and took super long to serve. When asked, they have not even re-prepared it. Very bad. Do not recommend at all."
"Super duper yummilicious üòã
Despite the long waiting time about an hour BUT worth the wait ü•∞
I will definitely come back again ‚úå"
The food are good with reasonable price. All staff are friendly. Definitely going back again.
"I bought the mentaiko chicken bowl worth rice on the 7/2/21. The chicken was so hard and salty, rice with the sauce is tasteless. It cost 7.80 and totally not worth it. I expect the chicken to be tender but it was so hard and dry. Very disappointed and will never buy from them again"
"nice! n shiok!
gd for top ups on meals and light supper!"
"Great and affordable don, Metaiko was just nice and not too overpowering, had the salmon mentaiko and was pleasantly surprised that i can still taste the salmon together with the mentaiko which are match made in heaven. Usually hate mentaiko due to its strong taste but i highly recommend theirs and you should definitely give it a try! LokLok were cheap and nice with the perfect seasoning as well :)"
#BestLokLok keep ordering more #Broccoli and ended up tabao-ing some home too!
"Very cheap Lok Lok at 1 dollar , their broccoli is damm nice , fried until super crispy .Their mapo tofu is very filling also ."
