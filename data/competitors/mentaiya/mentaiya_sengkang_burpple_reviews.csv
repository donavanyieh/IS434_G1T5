0,$8.80,mentaiko sauce overload but I'm not complaining. very filling to the point of almost jerlat. rice can be more moist. teriyaki sauce can be more generous.,https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/2b960409b08647a470e1913263_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format,0
1,Mentaiko Salmon,"J is a big fan of the salmon mentaiko don from @donyasingapore.

We were therefore keen to check out Mentai-Ya in (nearish) Seng Kang which specializes in the same dish.

Visual-wise, they look the same but Mentai-Ya's mentaiko sauce is milder compared to Donya's. However, their fish is more tender than Donya's which can be a little dry at times. It is slightly smaller in terms of portions as well.

If you prefer stronger flavours, Donya is probably the better bet but if you like something a little milder, do give @mentaiyasingapore a shot.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/3086f0eff0f5bd02c1241901815_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format,0
2,Non-spicy Mentai Soft Shell Crab($8.80),"Just for the bite. Not so crispy by the time it arrived but nonetheless, its still pretty tasty. Thanks to the mentaiko. Haha.

3,Tamago Mentaiyaki($6.80),"Sweet rolled-egg that give a pleasant sensation when eaten. The Mentai sauce and the egg flavour can be tasted differently distinctively on its own separately although when eaten together. It's a Yum. Sweet-savoury all at once.

4,Unagi Tama Don($12.80),"A classic piece. Chopped Unagi, fried egg and caramelised onion over sticky rice in savoury sauce, sprinkled with spring onion. Unagi was soft and holds a meaty texture. Sweetness of it was just right.
