1,for all Mentaiko lovers!,"Super affordable Mentaiko place! I had the Mentaiko salmon and spicy Mentaiko soft shell crab. They were so generous with their portions of salmon and mentaiko!

2,One of the Most Affordable & Tasty Japanese Food @ Tampines,"Ordered Spicy Mentai Chicken bowl and Mentai Salmon bowl, both under the price of $10. I have to say, it's definitely worth the amount spent. The chicken and salmon were really fresh! If you're concerned with the spice level of the spicy mentaiko sauce, be rest assured that there is a kick of spice, but definitely not too spicy. The amount of mentaiko sauce and portion of the meal provided was so generous and service was great! Looking forward to recommend this place to my friends and family. :)",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/33a79e79ebaf3db1c5821909032_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format,0
