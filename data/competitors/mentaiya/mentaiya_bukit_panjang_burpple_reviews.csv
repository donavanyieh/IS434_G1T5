0,Spicy Mentaiko Salmon Don,Very worth for its price! Highly recommend this place :). The portions were generous and the salmon with the mentaiko sauce tasted rich and gooood.,https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/3323f2b7c6f4f16955f81913566_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format,0
1,Salmon Mentai Don,"Yearning to try something new in Bukit Panjang and we chanced upon Mentai-Ya on Grab Food. After reading about the positive reviews online, we decided to give their mentai salmon don a try! We were honestly quite surprised at how generous the portion was for only $10 (excl. delivery charges). The portion of salmon was really decent and the amount of mentaiko paste given was way more than enough for the meal. In fact, it was bordering on the excessive, and it would be understandable if you are unable to finish all the mentaiko cream. That being said, this is one of the more affordable mentai-dons out there!",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/2f33ba11abfb2996a8301912731_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format,0

8,Salmon Mentaiko Don,"Costs about ~$12 excluding delivery charges from grabfood, very (very very very) generous with the mentaiko sauce, more than enough for the whole don. The salmon was not really that tender but still not too bad. Overall pretty enjoyable meal

9,Chicken Mentai Don,"??Hidden in a kopitiam in bukit panjang, the mentai don is pretty decent. The mentaiko that slightly torched and melted on the salmon or chicken katsu, bring the umami taste of the dish.
It can be better if the sauce on the rice to be balanced in a good amount.
