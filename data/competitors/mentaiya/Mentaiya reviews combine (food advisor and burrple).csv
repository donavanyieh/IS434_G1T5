Their salmon definitely generous in the size with lots of mentaiko on top
It would be understandable if you are unable to finish all the mentaiko cream
Japanese rice served with Crispy Chicken top
The mentai don is pretty decent
The serving of salmon was quite generous and the spicy mentaiko sauce was really good
The portion of salmon was really decent and the amount of mentaiko paste given was way more than enough for the meal
The salmon was not really that tender but still not too bad
Dons and fries were priced reasonably considering the amount of mentaiko added
INSANE amounts of mentaiko with great portions and sides
The portions were generous and the salmon with the mentaiko sauce tasted rich and gooood
Just a small kick that goes well with the mentaiko)
We were honestly quite surprised at how generous the portion was for only $10 (excl
Very (very very very) generous with the mentaiko sauce
Their fish is more tender than Donya's which can be a little dry at times
Grilled Salmon topped with a thick layer of flame torch mentaiko over sticky rice drizzled in soy sauce
Salmon skin was crisp and meat was tender
Sweetness of it was just right
They look the same but Mentai Ya's mentaiko sauce is milder compared to Donya's
"Food was good and very tasty! Affordable mentaiko Japanese food, the mentaiko fries were good and the spicy mentaiko was not too spicy or salty. Very nice meal"
"Super affordable Mentaiko place! I had the Mentaiko salmon and spicy Mentaiko soft shell crab. They were so generous with their portions of salmon and mentaiko! It was also my first time trying soft shell crab with spicy mentaiko, it was interesting :)"
"Ordered Spicy Mentai Chicken bowl and Mentai Salmon bowl, both under the price of $10. I have to say, it's definitely worth the amount spent. The chicken and salmon were really fresh! If you're concerned with the spice level of the spicy mentaiko sauce, be rest assured that there is a kick of spice, but definitely not too spicy. The amount of mentaiko sauce and portion of the meal provided was so generous and service was great! Looking forward to recommend this place to my friends and family. :)"
"Great place to satisfy mentaiko cravings, very affordable. Had the mentaiko salmon and spicy mentaiko fried chicken. Mentaiko mayo was really good and the heat in the spicy mentaiko made it better."
Never would have expect such great tasting mentai dish in a coffeeshop! The spicy or regular mentai is both great and the meats tasted great when paired with the mentaiko! 100% I'll be a returning customer (especially when its so near me! Yay!)
"I canâ€™t believe the mentaiko here is so good!! I love how the perfectly fried chicken goes with mentaiko - this is heaven in a bite. You canâ€™t find this quality at this price point anywhere else, highly recommend!"
Absolutely loved the thick and creamy spicy mentaiko sauce they have here! Really recommend trying out the Spicy Salmon Mentai!!
Great value and tasty food! I had the unagi tama don and the mentaiko soft shell crab but i forgot to take a pic of that one. I'm gonna get the salmon next time I'm in the east!
Good food good service good mentaiko. Ordered spicy salmon mentaiko Don and soft shell crab w mentaiko
"Located at a relatively new neighbourhood. Menu is interesting, especially for Mentai lovers. Do check out this place!"
Unique dishes in a neighbourhood setting. Got the soft shell crab and unagi bowl. There is a variety of other side dishes as well!
Love the flavour of the mentaiko here - sweet and tangy! Had the spicy salmon and mentaiko fries. The spicy salmon comes with the right level for spice for spice lovers and also the portion of the salmon cutlet is very value for money!
Very worth for its price! Highly recommend this place :). The portions were generous and the salmon with the mentaiko sauce tasted rich and gooood.
"Yearning to try something new in Bukit Panjang and we chanced upon Mentai-Ya on Grab Food. After reading about the positive reviews online, we decided to give their mentai salmon don a try! We were honestly quite surprised at how generous the portion was for only $10 (excl. delivery charges). The portion of salmon was really decent and the amount of mentaiko paste given was way more than enough for the meal. In fact, it was bordering on the excessive, and it would be understandable if you are unable to finish all the mentaiko cream. That being said, this is one of the more affordable mentai-dons out there!"
"Had lunch here for 2 pax! We got the Salmon Mentai Don, Unagi Don and Mentai Fries. Very tasty and value for money - would highly recommend. Was not a fan of mentaiko sauce before this but the Mentai Fries made me a convert!! ??"
Had the Spicy Mentaiko Salmon Don and it did not dissapoint! The serving of salmon was quite generous and the spicy mentaiko sauce was really good. Very reasonably priced for the quantity and quality!
"Good value, high quality, and great taste! Would recommend to anyone looking for a quick and easy dinner spot"
"Feature Spicy Chicken Mentai Don.
Japanese rice served with Crispy Chicken top, torched with generous spicy mentaiko (not overwhelmed the spiciness, just a small kick that goes well with the mentaiko).
??$7.8
Ps : any recommendations for bukit panjang food ? Please share to me ??. I'm starting explore bukit panjang now.

"Really affordable Japanese food located conveniently near a bus stop. Generous servings of mentaiko, dons and fries were priced reasonably considering the amount of mentaiko added. Will definitely visit again!"
"Hidden in Kopitiam along Senja Road there’s this affordable Japanese food stall selling their mentaiko don.

Their salmon definitely generous in the size with lots of mentaiko on top. Go for the spicy sauce to increase the taste."
"Costs about ~$12 excluding delivery charges from grabfood, very (very very very) generous with the mentaiko sauce, more than enough for the whole don. The salmon was not really that tender but still not too bad. Overall pretty enjoyable meal

8/10
"
"??Hidden in a kopitiam in bukit panjang, the mentai don is pretty decent. The mentaiko that slightly torched and melted on the salmon or chicken katsu, bring the umami taste of the dish.
It can be better if the sauce on the rice to be balanced in a good amount.

"If you love mentaiko, this is definitely the place for you! INSANE amounts of mentaiko with great portions and sides, worth the visit for sure."
mentaiko sauce overload but I'm not complaining. very filling to the point of almost jerlat. rice can be more moist. teriyaki sauce can be more generous.
"J is a big fan of the salmon mentaiko don from @donyasingapore.

We were therefore keen to check out Mentai-Ya in (nearish) Seng Kang which specializes in the same dish.

Visual-wise, they look the same but Mentai-Ya's mentaiko sauce is milder compared to Donya's. However, their fish is more tender than Donya's which can be a little dry at times. It is slightly smaller in terms of portions as well.

If you prefer stronger flavours, Donya is probably the better bet but if you like something a little milder, do give @mentaiyasingapore a shot."
"Just for the bite. Not so crispy by the time it arrived but nonetheless, its still pretty tasty. Thanks to the mentaiko. Haha.

"Sweet rolled-egg that give a pleasant sensation when eaten. The Mentai sauce and the egg flavour can be tasted differently distinctively on its own separately although when eaten together. It's a Yum. Sweet-savoury all at once.

"A classic piece. Chopped Unagi, fried egg and caramelised onion over sticky rice in savoury sauce, sprinkled with spring onion. Unagi was soft and holds a meaty texture. Sweetness of it was just right.

"Grilled Salmon topped with a thick layer of flame torch mentaiko over sticky rice drizzled in soy sauce. Salmon skin was crisp and meat was tender, paired with the all-time favourite savoury creamy mentaiko sauce, its enough to ascend you to Mentai-heaven.????
