0,Spicy Pork Don ($6++),"Picture doesn’t do the food justice but this is my fav don from the this place. The pork is spicy and super fragrant, super appetising and I would crave for it sometimes!!! Have tried their other dons including: salmon, chicken oyakodon and their katsu and all really rather worth for the price point. Salmon offered tomato salad which was good! The katsu might get abit soggy and no longer crispy so would not reco that if you are going to takeaway",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/3367cac470f4922590ec1895879_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format,0
1,Teriyaki Beef Short Plate W/ Onsen Egg ($6.90),"Was at Marine parade and saw this stall selling Japanese don with a constant queue. So I decided to try their don. The person took my order and wrote on a slip on paper my order and order number. She gave me one slip and the other slip to the person preparing the food. The cashier would then shout the order number once the order is done. So I would advise those ordering to get seats near the stall so that you know when your food is ready.
I got their Teriyaki Beef Short Plate W/ Onsen Egg which consists of Beef Short Plate, Onions, Onsen Egg and Furikake.
So I think my dish did not come with onions? Either that or they minced the onions really fine. So on to the rice. The rice was not bad, drenched with the beef drippings which added flavour to the plain rice. Beef was tender and was coated with teriyaki sauce and topped with Furikake. For the Furikake I think it did not add much value to the entire dish and I mostly tasted togarashi (Japanese chili powder) from it. On to the Onsen egg. Was a little disappointed as the yolk already broke.
Overall it was a very average tasting bowl of beef and I felt that they could have given slightly more meat for the don or maybe add the Furikake on the rice instead of just the meat so that at least when people eat the rice itself there's some taste.",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/2f29a36910d91f5f826a1890401_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format,0
2,Sukiyaki Beef Short Plate Don w/ Onsen Egg $6.9,"The folks at @fukudonsg have got their mise en place and kitchen line down to a tee, enabling them to serve a steady stream of customers quickly. This doesn’t always work in their favour. While the beef was tender and unctuous, the onsen egg yolk was already overcooked. Nevertheless, spot on flavours, although as always, their rice bowls could definitely do with more sauce.
Taste: 3/5",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/17f4033786091d2bc1885133_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format,1
3,Spicy Pork Don ($6.6),"A photo that doesn’t do the dish justice. That char on the pork and the perfectly cook rice that still has a good bite to it. Not to mention, the sauces all complemented the dish super well. Gem at Marine Parade Central Market Hawker! The guys at the stall were SUPER nice and friendly too.",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/4d9017b2ec0f85c3edc1884551_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format,1
4,Pork Belly Katsu Don $6.6,"Oh my stars, look at that golden crust encasing each glistening piece of meat. A pity it was already soggy by the time i received it. I expected pork belly to be more fatty and tender, but this was lean if still tasty. The soft scrambled eggs with onion was perfectly cooked, howeverIi wish there were more of it or at least had some sauce to go along with the plentiful rice below.

5,Shoyu Glaze Salmon Don $6.9,"I'd be hard-pressed to find another place serving a salmon don of this quality at this price point and because of their budget friendly yet tasty donburis, the queue starts forming way before their shutters go up for lunch everyday at noon.
Each serving comes with 3 pieces of succulent, oily salmon coated in a tangy shoyu lemon glaze and a side of @fukudonsg Japanese tomato salad over a bed of al dente calrose rice. While the portion is small, every bite is flavour packed. If you want to get your hands on this, come before 1pm because it’s one of their bestsellers and they run out of it inevitably.
Taste: 3.5/5",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/17f4026f1e5b6bf7c1883106_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format,0
6,Tomato Salad $3.5,"Salad at a hawker stall and Japanese-style at that? Consider me sold. Chunks of fresh local tomatoes and Japanese cucumber dressed in a goma sauce are the primary components here. What makes it a little more special are the translucent strings of white onion which have been lightly pickled to take away the rawness, unexpected but welcome segments of sweet mandarin and a savoury sprinkling of furikake to finish. All these lend depth of flavour and texture to something that could have ended up as an afterthought.

7,Pork Belly Katsu Don,"Wasn’t intending to settle dinner at Marine Parade Food Centre initially, but was pretty bummed for the fact that the spot I intended to dine at in the area had many items on the menu being unavailable — and thus I found myself heading to the food centre and checking Fukudon out, which describes themselves as an Asian Fusion Donburi Specialist which I have been following on social media for quite a while.
Felt that the “Asian Fusion Donburi” branding was a bit of a far stretch given how the various Donburi being offered on the menu here (i.e. Chicken Breast Oyakodon, Shoyu Glaze Salmon Don, Sukiyaki Beef Short Plate Don with Onsen Eg etc.) all sound pretty Japanese-inspired — that being said, we were more than impressed with the Pork Belly Katsu Don which we had opted for. While the fried pork belly seems to carry more bite and was less gelatinous and fatty than what we had initially expected especially given the illustrations on the menu, the element that sealed the deal for us was the runny egg which is simmered in dashi broth alongside onions — incredibly runny and silky, the eggs also carried a punchy savoury note that provides so much flavour to the entire dish, with the sauce even permeating the bed of short-grain rice below that gives the otherwise plain rice some moisture and a sweet-savoury note. Japanese spicy powder has also been sprinkled over the top to provide the Donburi with a slight hint of spiciness — just enough to tickle the tastebuds without overwhelming the entire dish.
Given what we had tried at Fukudon, we were left pretty impressed with what they have to offer — the execution of the eggs here were particularly noteworthy, and is pretty much an important element that makes up a good Oyakodon and Katsudon. While it’s offerings seem to be rather Japanese at heart, they do seem to have places quite a bit of effort in trying to serve up quality food for the masses at pocket-friendly prices. Quite interested in their Thunder Crunchy Fries which comes either with Homemade Curry Sauce or Mentaiko Sauce — something which I am pretty keen to try on my subsequent visit here.",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/1c299c88d524e603afe1879464_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format,1
8,Pork Belly Katsu Don,"Saw this new stall in Marine Parade Food Centre operating by bunch of young people, serving donburi in this food court.
Although they just opened very recently but they have attracted long queue during peak hours.
Go for their signature pork belly katsu don, topped with slices of thick, crispy and juicy pork katsu; simmered together with egg, onion and Japanese rice.
The portion wasn’t big but sufficient for me. $6.60",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/52ed0a162ab90894b2a1870330_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format,0
