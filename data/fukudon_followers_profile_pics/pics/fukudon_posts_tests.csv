Have you heard of this beautiful Pottery &amp; Vegetarian Cafe nestled in Capitol?

This is the place to hang out with friends, family.
You can have pottery lessons and drink tea at the same time! So therapeutic and relaxing 😍

We tried

Jardin Bibimbap ($20)
🥗 Barley Rice mixed with carrots, spinach, capsicum, zucchini, bean sprouts and a poached egg with tasty Korean chilli paste. The quality of the ingredients they use are very good and fresh!  And brings out the taste of healthy Korean cuisine.

Hand Drip Coffee ($9)
☕️ Robust coffee Hand dripped by Oppa 😋

🫖 Antoninette!s Affair Lychee ($9)
Beautiful tea that comes in a whole flower blossom. Really like the Lychee and light tea flavour.

@ishirosg is a Japanese fusion Donburi concept that aims to captivate patrons with its unique  flavours &amp; affordable dishes with healthy options too!

What we had:
🐠 Mentaiko Salmon Bowl $9.40
🐠Unagi Bowl $11.40

💛 Chicken Karaage $6

I love Salmon Mentaiko and their bowl definitely met my expectations! It’s like good quality restaurant in a hawker setting. The onsen egg that comes with it is also cooked perfectly! 
The same goes for the unagi bowl with it’s generous portions and juicy flesh, again perfect with the onsen egg. They also use good pearl 🍚 

I would definitely recommend anyone looking for good quality Japanese food at affordable prices! They have a few outlets, so check them out 💛

This halal chillax and cozy cafe serves up pretty authentic Mexican fare and bites.

What we had:

Appetiser:

~ Classy Nachos ($15.90)
Chicken 🐓 with melted cheese 🧀, home-made guacamole, Pico De Gallo and corn.
One can never go wrong with some classy nachos. Always a great start as an appetiser to share. 👍

Mains:

~ Pizzamasa ($18.90) 🍕 
A 12"" crisp tortilla base topped with beef chorizo, cheddar 🧀 Parmesan Salsa Roja and Pico De Gallo 
A super flavourful 🍕- perfect for sharing! 😍👍

~ Shank You ($27)
A 24-hour slow cooked lamb shank 🐑 with spicy roasted baby potatoes 🥔, Pepita and Cilantro Gremolata in Tangy Olive Oil.
A succulent, tender and flavourful lamb 🐑 shank dish. What more to say… 😋

Gotta end our meal with sweet treat:

~ Churros ($10.90)
Coated in Cinnamon Sugar with Chocolate 🍫 Sauce. 
Freshly made with crispy and crunchy exterior yet light and airy on the inside! 
So good on its own or dip it in the chocolate sauce for the extra sweetness! 🥰❤️

Refreshing summery concoctions 🍹:

~ Sunrise in Tulum ($8.90) 
A drink consists of Pina Coco, wildberry, lime juice and sun orange in soda water with mint 

~ Earl Grey Cold Brew ($5.50)

~ Laying on Your Coconut 🥥 ($8.90) 
Coconut Water, Pina Coco with lime juice and basil

We were so stuffed at the end of this meal that we needed a long walk to digest all the yummies we just had… 🤣🤪
Perfect weather today too, so thankful for that.

Remember to refuel for another great week ahead, peeps!

Spicy 🥵 &amp; Indulgent to keep you warm and cozy!!👍🥰 

One of the many comfort food that I go for when my day's been less than ideal. Amy Stew( Budae Jjigae) in a claypot 🍲is a solid meal overall. It is Korean hot pot loaded with Kimchi, spam, different kind of mushrooms🍄🍄, sausages, lettuce 🥬, pork belly &amp; pork collar🥓🥓, tteokbokki, tofu, ramen 🍜, cheese 🧀, onion 🧅 and much more!

Well, great company is even better 😀😀We slurp till the very last drop, shiok!😋😋
Warning:⚠️⚠️ A pot of addictive and high calories food!!💕💕

Simply easy to make this pot of goodness. 

🌟Mix 4Tbsp Korean chili flakes (Gochugaru), 4 Tbsp mirin, 2Tbsp soy sauce, 2Tbsp minced garlic, 1Tbsp sugar, 3Tbsp Korean chili paste (Gochujang)and a few sprinkles of ground black pepper in small bowl. You can adjust based on your preferance for the sauce.

🌟All you need is to assemble the ingredients including the sauce (except for instant ramen noodles, rice cakes, chopped chilies 🌶 &amp; green onion and cheese 🧀) in the pot. 

🌟Pour in homemade 1.5litre chicken stock and let it boil for about 10 mins. Once boil, add it instant ramen noodles, rice cakes, green onion and cheese to cook for about 2 mins. Lower heat if you are using portable burner and Enjoy! We cooked in a claypot  to keep the food warm while enjoying on dining table.

⭐️Matcha 🍵 Mont Blanc -Intense earthiness matcha taste provides the prefect contrast to the sweetness of chestnut mousse. Work wonder on the eye of matcha lover.☺️

⭐️ Strawberry 🍓 St Honore
- Light and creamy strawberry 🍓 chantilly cream beautifully stages on top of baked pistachio frangipane in crunchy tart shell. Decorated with strawberry macarons at the side. Chewy jam sandwiched between crisp exterior macarons.

⭐️Pineapple 🍍Tart
- Uniquely fusion twist to satisfy those pineapple lover. Coconut crumble and diced pineapple 🍍 blend well with pineapple jam where you will get the relish of tropical sweetness in a cookie like tart

Hazelnut &amp; Feuilletine 🍫 
- Sweet &amp; nutty 🥜 flavour combination between the layering is my favorite on a crunchy hazelnut base. That’s a bonus.

⭐️Botanic Garden 🪴Tea 🫖
- refreshing pot to pair with all those pastries

Head over to @delicatesse.sg with your friends to chill and enjoy those dainty pastries together.

Welcome Snack
Daily rotation of surprises from the kitchen

1st Course
Foie Gras &amp; Duck Leg Terrine - Strawberries / Brioche / Balsamic
OR
Mussel Chowder Blue - Lip Mussel / XO Sauce

2nd Course
Green Curry Barramundi - Green Curry Pea Puree / Tom Kah / Compressed Green Mango
OR
Roasted Cod - Ginger &amp; Soy Veloute / Fish Maw / Preserved Cabbage Salad

3rd Course
Herb Crusted Lamb Rack - Raspberry Puree / Lemon Verbena &amp; Hazelnut Crust / Smoked Lamb Jus
OR
Wagyu Cheek Rendang - Spiced Potato Cake / Purple Potato Chip / Home-Made Rendang Paste

Dessert
Mango Sticky Rice - Caramelized Mango / Coconut “Rice” Crisps &amp; Sorbet
OR
Durian Cheesecake - Durian Cheesecake

It was a wonderful dining experience. Each dish looks exquisite, and the portion and taste are good. The Foie Gras &amp; Confit Duck Leg Terrine is rich and creamy with a refreshing taste from strawberry. The Roasted Cod is also very nice, very soft and smooth. The Lamb Rack and Wagyu Cheek Rendang both are very soft and tender! Go for Lamb Rack if you like something unique and refreshing. And go for the Wagyu Cheek if you prefer savoury. I think both desserts is mind-blow creation. I prefer this version of Mango Sticky Rice over the original one! The Durian Cheesecake is made with Musang King Durian. Don't forget to try out their beautiful cocktails/mojito too🍸

Eat ramen!! 🍜@ramenkingsg is opened by Chef Simon Song, who is formerly from Ramen Santouka. Ramen can be found everywhere but can you find affordable ramen which is just as good? 🥺
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I have tried the Tonkotsu ramen ($8) and Kurobuta Toroniku Spicy Miso ramen ($15). Their ramen prices range from $8 - $9.50 with the exception of the Kurobuta Toroniku ones.
Their ramen here is the kind of restaurant standard and the broth is rich. The tonkotsu one has that kind of rich and milky consistency, whereas the miso one has a savory one with a slight fiery kick. The charsiew for the tonkotsu is on the thinner side but the kurobuta one was tender and nice. 
I really enjoyed slurping the ramen! 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
They have gyoza and cheese gyoza as sides.

The fresh pasteurised Ramen is higher in protein and lower in sodium comparing to the other cooked oriental noodles in the market. 👍🏼 

Added some simple ingredients like Egg Tofu, Luncheon Meat, Enoki Mushrooms, Ramen Egg (cook in boiling water for 6 minutes and put in ice water after), some Fried Garlic, chopped Spring Onions and a packet of ready-to-cook Tomato broth! 🤩 

And most importantly, it is super easy and convenient to prepare the Ramen, just parboil the ramen in boiling water for 30 seconds, topped it up with the broth and other cooked ingredients, and a hearty bowl of Tomato Ramen is ready within minutes! Love the soft &amp; springy texture of the Ramen, and it goes so well with the tangy tomato broth! 🥰
